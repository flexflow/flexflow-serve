      "prompt": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms",
      "response": "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from traditional computers, which use bits to store and process information. Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can store and process more information than classical bits because they can be in multiple states at the same time. This means that quantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.\n\nOne way to think about quantum computers is to imagine a traditional computer as a set of coins that can only be heads or tails. A quantum computer is like a set of coins that can be heads, tails, or both heads and tails at the same time. This allows quantum computers to explore many possibilities at once, which can be very useful for certain types of problems.\n\nQuantum computing is still a relatively new field, and there are many challenges to building and using quantum computers. However, researchers are making progress and it is expected that quantum computers will have many applications in the future, including in fields such as chemistry, materials science, and machine learning.",

      "response": "There are many ways that public policy can be used to reduce inequality in society. Some options include:\n\n1. Increasing access to education: By providing education to more people, particularly disadvantaged groups, public policy can help to increase equality of opportunity and reduce income inequality.\n2. Implementing progressive taxation: By taxing higher earners at a higher rate, governments can redistribute wealth and income to those who are less well-off.\n3. Providing social welfare programs: Governments can provide assistance to disadvantaged groups, such as low-income families, the unemployed, and the elderly, through programs such as unemployment insurance, food stamps, and social security.\n4. Regulating the labor market: Public policy can be used to regulate the labor market and protect the rights of workers, including by setting minimum wages and mandating certain benefits, such as paid leave and health insurance.\n5. Investing in infrastructure: Public investment in infrastructure, such as transportation and public utilities, can help to create jobs and stimulate economic growth, which can in turn reduce inequality.",

      "prompt": "I am from NZ. Most of these sound like benifits schemes rather than true UBI. What is the definition of UBI and does New Zealand's benifit match the definition?",
      "response": "Universal Basic Income (UBI) is defined as a periodic, unconditional cash payment provided to all individuals in a society, regardless of their employment status, income level, or other factors. It is intended to ensure a minimum standard of living and reduce poverty and inequality. Key features of UBI include:\n\n1. Universality: It is provided to all citizens, without means-testing or work requirements.\n2. Unconditionality: It is given without any strings attached or conditions to fulfill.\n3. Periodicity: It is distributed regularly (e.g., monthly, quarterly) rather than as a one-time payment.\n4. Individuality: It is given to individuals rather than households or families.\n5. Cash payment: It is provided in the form of cash, allowing recipients the freedom to use the money as they see fit.\n\nNew Zealand has a social welfare system that includes various benefits and allowances, such as Jobseeker Support, Sole Parent Support, Supported Living Payment, and Accommodation Supplement. These programs are designed to provide financial assistance to people who are unemployed, have disabilities, are raising children alone, or have housing costs.\n\nHowever, New Zealand's benefit system does not qualify as a true UBI. It is means-tested, conditional, and targeted at specific groups rather than being universal and unconditional. While these benefits play a crucial role in supporting vulnerable populations and reducing poverty, they do not meet the definition of a UBI.\n\nIn recent years, there have been discussions in New Zealand about the potential implementation of a UBI, but as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, no nationwide UBI program had been introduced.",

Data Exfiltration: The attackers exfiltrate the collected data from the target network to a Command and Control (C2) server, which is controlled by the APT group.\n6. Data Encryption: The attackers encrypt the exfiltrated data using a strong encryption algorithm, making it difficult for the target organization to access the stolen data.\n7. Extortion Demand: The attackers send a ransom demand to the target organization, threatening to release the stolen data if their demands are not met.\n8. Negotiations: The target organization may attempt to negotiate with the attackers, trying to reduce the ransom amount or secure a guarantee that the stolen data will not be released.\n9. Payment: If the target organization agrees to pay the ransom, the attackers will provide them with the decryption key to access the stolen data.\n10.

      "response": "Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. It is usually expressed as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 representing an impossible event and 1 representing a certain event. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads is 0.5, because there is an equal chance of getting either heads or tails.\n\nThere are several different ways to calculate probability, but one common method is to use the formula:\n\nProbability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes\n\nFor example, if you were rolling a die and wanted to know the probability of rolling a 4, the number of favorable outcomes would be 1 (there is only 1 way to roll a 4) and the total number of outcomes would be 6 (there are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a die). So, the probability of rolling a 4 would be 1/6, or about 0.17.\n\nProbability can also be expressed as a percentage. To convert a probability to a percentage, simply multiply the probability by 100. For example, the probability of rolling a 4 on a die is about 0.17, which is equal to 17% when expressed as a percentage.\n\nI hope this helps!

This can be useful for performing operations on all the values in the Map.\n3.

Ordering: Maps maintain the order in which elements were added, which can be useful when iterating over the Map.\n5. Faster Search: In JavaScript, objects use hash tables to store key-value pairs. This can lead to performance issues when searching for a specific value. Maps, on the other hand, use a tree structure, which provides faster search times for large collections.\n6. Garbage Collection: Objects in JavaScript can cause memory leaks if not handled correctly. Maps are designed to avoid these issues by automatically removing unused elements.",

Sketching: One of the simplest and most effective ways to visualize your project is to sketch it out on paper. You can use graph paper to help you draw to scale, and include measurements and details such as where the doors and ramps will be located.\n2. 3D modeling software: If you want a more detailed and realistic visualization, you can use 3D modeling software such as SketchUp or Blender. These programs allow you to create a digital model of your enclosure, complete with textures and materials.\n3. Online planning tools: There are also a number of online planning tools that can help you create a layout and design for your guinea pig enclosure. For example, the website \"Guinea Pig Cages\" offers a free online tool that allows you to create a custom enclosure using pre-made templates and drag-and-drop features.\n4. Physical models: Another option is to create a physical model of your enclosure using cardboard or foam board. This can help you visualize the design in 3D and make any necessary changes before you start building.\n\nBy using these tools, you can get a better idea of what your guinea pig enclosure will look like and make any necessary adjustments before you start building.",

      "prompt": "please explain why colors are inverted in the world during a period in which time is stopped",
      "response": "The scenario you described, where time is stopped and colors are inverted, is purely hypothetical and has no basis in our current understanding of the laws of physics. However, I can try to provide an explanation based on some assumptions and hypothetical situations.\n\nFirstly, let's consider what is meant by \"time being stopped.\" Time is a fundamental dimension of the universe, and it's unclear what it would mean for time to be stopped. However, for the sake of argument, let's assume that time being stopped means that all physical processes in the universe have come to a complete halt.\n\nNow, let's consider why colors might appear inverted in this scenario. Color perception is a complex process that involves the brain's interpretation of the wavelengths of light that are detected by the eyes. In the absence of any physical processes, there would be no light being emitted, reflected or refracted. This would mean that there would be no colors to perceive at all.\n\nHowever, if we assume that there is some kind of residual light that is still being emitted or reflected in this hypothetical scenario, then it's possible that the colors might appear inverted. This could happen if the process by which light is perceived is also affected by the stopping of time. For example, if the rods and cones in our eyes were affected by the stopping of time in such a way that the wavelengths of light were perceived in reverse order, then colors might appear inverted.\n\nIn conclusion, the scenario you described is purely hypothetical, and there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that time can be stopped or that colors would appear inverted in such a scenario. However, it's an interesting thought experiment that can help us explore the complexities of color perception and the nature of time itself.",

      "prompt": "2.5 The money pump argument\nThe assumption that a choice function is rationalizable is sometimes defended\non the ground that behavior that is inconsistent with rationality could produce\nchoices that harm the individual.\nSuppose that X consists of three alternatives, a, b, and c , interpreted as objects, and that an individual\u2019s choice function assigns a to {a,b}, b to {b, c }, and\nc to {a, c }. An implication of this choice function is that for any object x, if the\nindividual holds x then there is an object y such that the individual is willing to\nexchange x for y ; given that he prefers y to x, he is willing to pay some (possibly small) amount of money to make the exchange. Assume that for each such\nexchange, this amount of money is at least $1. In this case, a manipulator could\nfirst give a to the individual, then offer to replace a with c in return for $1, then\n24 Chapter 2. Choice\noffer to replace c with b in return for another $1, and then offer to replace b with\na for yet another $1. After these three exchanges, the individual holds a, as he\ndid initially, and is $3 poorer. The manipulator can repeat the exercise, taking as\nmuch money from the individual as he likes. Such a mechanism is known as a\nmoney pump.\nIn fact, for any choice function c that does not satisfy condition \u03b1, such manipulation is possible. Assume that there are sets A and B with B \u2282 A \u2286 X and\nc (A) \u2208 B and c (B) 6= c (A). The manipulation goes as follows.\nTake c (A). (i) Are you willing to replace c (A) with any element in B \\{c (A)} for\nsome amount of money? The individual can now choose from the set B and will\nagree and choose c (B). (ii) Are you willing to replace c (B) with an alternative in\nA \\ {c (B)} for some amount of money? The individual can now choose from the\nentire set A and will agree and choose c (A). The manipulator can repeat the two\nsteps as many times as he wishes.\nThe effectiveness of the manipulation depends on the inability of the manipulated individual to notice the exploitation. We leave it to you to judge\nwhether the argument is a persuasive justification of the assumption that choice\nis rationalizable.\n2.6 Evidence of choices inconsistent with rationality\nAmple research demonstrates that human behavior is sometimes not rational in\nthe sense we have defined. From the multitude of examples, we select three experiments that demonstrate this point; for each example, we identify features of\nbehavior that are inconsistent with the assumption of rational behavior. The first\nexperiment involves a situation in which some subjects\u2019 choices conflict with\nproperty \u03b1. The second and third experiments challenge the assumption that\nan individual chooses an alternative from a set, independently of the way the\nset is described. The experiments were first conducted many years ago (see the\nNotes at the end of the chapter). Here we report results of online experiments\n(using the website http://gametheory.tau.ac.il) in which the subjects were a\nlarge number of students around the world with similar academic backgrounds\nto those of the potential readers of this book.\n2.6.1 Attention effect\nWhich of the following cameras do you choose?\nCamera A Average rating 9.1, 6 megapixels\nCamera B Average rating 8.3, 9 megapixels\n2.6 Evidence of inconsistency 25\nNow make another choice.\nWhich of the following cameras do you choose?\nCamera A Average rating 9.1, 6 megapixels\nCamera B Average rating 8.3, 9 megapixels\nCamera C Average rating 8.1, 7 megapixels\nEach question was answered by about 1,300 participants on the website\nhttp://gametheory.tau.ac.il. The results are given in the following tables.\nChoice between A and B\nCamera A 48%\nCamera B 52%\nChoice between A, B, and C\nCamera A 30%\nCamera B 68%\nCamera C 2%\nThus the appearance of C does not lead people to choose C, but rather\ncauses a significant fraction of participants to choose B, which dominates C,\neven though in a choice between A and B they choose A. One explanation of this\nresult is that the availability of C directs the participants\u2019 focus to B, the alternative that dominates it. An alternative explanation is that the dominance of B\nover C provides a reason to choose B, a reason that does not apply to A.\n2.6.2 Framing effects\nSometimes individuals\u2019 choices depend on the way in which the alternatives are\ndescribed.\nYou have to spin either roulette A or roulette B. The outcomes of\nspinning each roulette are given in the following table.\nWhite Red Green Yellow\nroulette A 90% 6% 1% 3%\n$0 $45 $30 \u2212$15\nroulette B 90% 7% 1% 2%\n$0 $45 \u2212$10 \u2212$15\nWhich roulette do you choose?\nSubjects\u2019 choices in this experiment are generally split more or less equally\nbetween the two roulettes. About 51% of around 4,000 participants at the website\nhttp://gametheory.tau.ac.il have chosen A.\n26 Chapter 2. Choice\nA common explanation for the choice of A is that the problem is complicated\nand participants simplify it by \u201ccanceling\u201d similar parameters. The outcomes\nof White in the two roulettes are identical and the outcomes of Red and Yellow\nare very similar; ignoring these colors leaves Green, which yields a much better\noutcome for roulette A.\nHere is another choice problem.\nYou have to spin either roulette C or roulette D. The outcomes of\nspinning each roulette are given in the following table.\nWhite Red Black Green Yellow\nroulette C 90% 6% 1% 1% 2%\n$0 $45 $30 \u2212$15 \u2212$15\nroulette D 90% 6% 1% 1% 2%\n$0 $45 $45 \u2212$10 \u2212$15\nWhich roulette do you choose?\nIt is clear that D dominates C, and indeed almost all participants (93%) at\nhttp://gametheory.tau.ac.il have chosen D.\nNow notice that A andC differ only in their presentation (the color Yellow in A\nis split in C into two contingencies). The same is true of B and D (the color Red\nin B is split in D into two contingencies). The different presentations seem to\ncause at least half of the participants to apply different choice procedures: they\nreduce the complicated problem to a simpler one in the choice between A and B\nand apply a domination criterion in the choice between C and D.\n2.6.3 Mental accounting\nImagine that you have bought a ticket for a show for $40. When\nyou reach the theatre you discover that you have lost the ticket.\nYou can buy another ticket at the same price. Will you do so?\nNow think about another situation.\nImagine that you intend to go to a show. When you take your wallet out of your pocket to pay for the $40 ticket, you discover that\nyou have lost $40, but you still have enough cash to buy a ticket.\nWill you do so?\nProblems 27\nIn both of these situations, you face a choice between\n1. having $80 less than you did before departing home and seeing the performance\n2. having $40 less than you did before departing home and not seeing the performance.\nAlthough in both situations you face these same options, more people choose\nto buy the ticket in the second situation than in the first situation. About 65%\nof the 1,200 participants at http://gametheory.tau.ac.il have stated that\nthey would buy a new ticket in the first situation, in which they discover they\nhave lost a ticket they purchased previously. Among a similar number of different participants, 79% have stated they would buy a ticket after discovering that\nthey had lost $40. The reason for the difference seems to be that in the first case\npeople follow a mental accounting process that counts the price of a ticket as\n$80, and they regard that price as too high. In the second case, some people appear to think about the loss of the $40 as unrelated to the issue of ticket purchase\nand count the price of a ticket as only $40.",
      "response": "In section 2.6, the text discusses evidence of choices inconsistent with rationality, providing examples from various experiments that challenge the assumption that individuals make rational decisions. Three experiments are discussed:\n\n1. Attention effect: This experiment shows how the presence of an additional option (Camera C) influences people's choices between two other options (Camera A and Camera B). The appearance of C doesn't lead people to choose it but causes a significant fraction of participants to choose B, even though they would choose A in a choice between A and B without C. This suggests that the presence of an additional option can shift people's attention and affect their choices.\n2. Framing effects: This experiment demonstrates that individuals' choices can depend on how the alternatives are presented. In the roulette choice problems, different presentations cause at least half of the participants to apply different choice procedures, simplifying the complicated problem in the choice between roulette A and B and applying a domination criterion in the choice between roulette C and D.\n3. Mental accounting: This experiment shows how people's decisions can be influenced by their mental accounting process. When participants were asked if they would buy a new ticket after losing a purchased ticket or after losing an equivalent amount of cash, more people chose to buy the ticket in the second situation. The reason for the difference seems to be related to how people mentally account for the cost of the ticket in each scenario.\n\nThese experiments reveal that human behavior is sometimes not rational and can be influenced by factors such as the presentation of alternatives, the presence of additional options, and mental accounting processes.",

This will make the bird jump.\n\nOf course, this is just a starting point, and there is much more you can do to make the game more interesting, such as adding obstacles, scoring, and so on. But this should give you a good starting point for creating your own Flappy Bird-like game in Unity.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

They are often highly driven, ambitious, and set challenging goals for themselves and their team. Examples of pacesetters include successful business leaders, athletes, and military leaders.\n\nPacesetting leadership can be effective when the team is highly motivated and skilled, and when the goal is to achieve a specific, measurable outcome. In these situations, pacesetters can set a fast pace and push the team to achieve results quickly.\n\nHowever, pacesetting leadership can also be detrimental when the team is not ready for the high level of intensity and pressure that the pacesetter sets. Additionally, pacesetters may be less effective in situations where the goal is more focused on process or building relationships, rather than achieving a specific outcome. This is because pacesetters tend to focus on results, rather than on the process or the team's well-being.",

Given a data logger that is initialized with a file path that exists and has data in it, when the data logger is used to log a message, then the message should be appended to the end of the file.\n5. Given a data logger that is initialized with a file path that exists and has reached its maximum size limit, when the data logger is used to log a message, then the data logger should create a new file and write the message to the new file, while also preserving the data in the original file.\n6.

      "prompt": "how do marketing strategies differ in developed vs developing countries",
      "response": "Marketing strategies can differ between developed and developing countries due to a variety of factors. Some of the main differences include the stage of economic development, the availability of resources and infrastructure, and the level of competition in the market.\n\nIn developed countries, businesses typically have access to a larger and more sophisticated market, with well-established infrastructure and a larger pool of potential customers. This allows for the use of more complex and advanced marketing strategies, such as targeted advertising and product differentiation.\n\nIn contrast, developing countries often have more limited resources and infrastructure, and the market may be less mature. This can make it more difficult to implement complex marketing strategies, and businesses may need to focus more on basic marketing techniques such as product promotion and price competition. Additionally, developing countries may have more limited access to technology and other resources, which can further complicate the marketing process.\n\nOverall, the key difference between marketing strategies in developed and developing countries is the level of complexity and sophistication that is possible. In developed countries, businesses have more resources and a more established market, which allows for the use of more advanced marketing strategies. In contrast, developing countries may need to focus on more basic marketing techniques due to a lack of resources and a less developed market.",

Harry becomes obsessed with the mirror and spends several nights gazing into it, mesmerized by the image of his deceased parents. However, Dumbledore warns Harry that the mirror is dangerous and can lead one to become lost in their own desires, causing them to forget the importance of the present moment.

As he arrived at the synagogue, he was greeted by the rabbi and several members of the congregation who were excited to meet him.\n\nAs Shlomo prepared to perform, he noticed that one of the congregants, an elderly man, was sitting alone and seemed sad. Shlomo approached him and asked if he was okay. The man replied that he was mourning the loss of his wife, who had passed away a few months earlier.\n\nShlomo was moved by the man's story and decided to dedicate his performance to the memory of the man's wife. As he sang, he poured all his emotions into the music, creating a powerful and uplifting atmosphere in the synagogue.\n\nAfter the performance, the man approached Shlomo with tears in his eyes and thanked him for dedicating the performance to his wife. He said that he had felt her presence in the music and that it had given him comfort and strength.\n\nMoved by the man's words, Shlomo sat with him and listened as he shared stories about his wife and their life together. As they talked, Shlomo began to improvise a song, weaving the man's memories into the lyrics.\n\nThe man was amazed as he heard Shlomo's song, which captured the essence of his wife's spirit and their love for each other. He thanked Shlomo again and again, saying that he had never felt so close to his wife since she had passed away.\n\nAs Shlomo left the synagogue that day, he felt grateful for the opportunity to use his music to bring comfort and healing to others. He knew that music had the power to transcend boundaries and connect people in a way that nothing else could, and he felt blessed to be able to share that gift with the world.",

      "response": "Birds communicate in a variety of ways, including vocalizations, visual displays, and body language.\n\nVocalizations are the most common form of communication among birds. Each species has its own unique set of calls, songs, and other vocalizations that they use to communicate with other birds. Birds use their vocalizations to establish territories, attract mates, warn of predators, and alert other birds to food sources.\n\nVisual displays are also an important form of communication among birds. Some birds use visual displays to attract mates, establish dominance, or signal aggression. For example, male peacocks use their brightly colored plumage to attract females, while other birds use displays of aggression, such as spreading their wings or puffing out their chest feathers, to deter rivals.\n\nBody language is another important form of communication among birds. Birds use their posture, position, and movement to convey information to other birds. For example, a bird may tilt its head to the side or raise its feathers to signal that it is interested or alert.\n\nIn addition to these forms of communication, some birds also use chemical signals to communicate. For example, some birds use scent markings to signal their presence or territorial boundaries to other birds.\n\nOverall, birds use a combination of vocalizations, visual displays, body language, and chemical signals to communicate with each other and convey important information about their behavior, status, and environment.",

      "prompt": "Define interrupt, vector and non-vector interrupt and write difference between vector and non-vector interrupt in a table",
      "response": "An interrupt is a signal to the processor that an event has occurred and requires immediate attention. Interrupts allow a system to handle events asynchronously, rather than having to wait for each event to be completed before moving on to the next task.\n\nA vector interrupt is an interrupt that uses a unique address, known as a vector, to indicate the location of the interrupt handler. This allows the processor to quickly identify the appropriate interrupt handler and begin executing it.\n\nA non-vector interrupt, on the other hand, does not use a unique address to indicate the location of the interrupt handler. Instead, the processor must determine the appropriate interrupt handler using other means, such as a lookup table or a software routine.\n\nHere is a table summarizing the differences between vector and non-vector interrupts:\n\n|  | Vector Interrupt | Non-Vector Interrupt |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Addressing | Unique address (vector) used to locate the interrupt handler | No unique address used; processor must determine the handler |\n| Processing time | Faster processing time due to quick identification of the handler | Slower processing time due to additional processing required to determine the handler |\n| Handler complexity | Handlers can be complex since they can be located at a fixed address | Handlers may be simpler since they can be located anywhere in memory |\n| Programming | Requires more complex programming to set up the vector table | Easier to set up, but requires additional programming to determine the handler |\n\nIn general, vector interrupts are faster and more efficient, but require more complex programming to set up. Non-vector interrupts are easier to set up but may be slower and less efficient. The choice between vector and non-vector interrupts depends on the specific requirements of the system and the resources available.",

      "response": "Think-aloud pair problem-solving is a technique used to promote critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities in students. It involves pairing students together and having them work on a problem or task while verbalizing their thought processes out loud.\n\nDuring this process, students explain how they are approaching the problem, what strategies they are using, and what obstacles they are encountering. The partner listens actively and provides feedback, suggestions, and additional insights that can help the student refine their thinking and improve their problem-solving skills.\n\nThis technique can be used in teaching to enhance learning outcomes by encouraging students to think deeply and engage in metacognition, the process of thinking about one's own thinking. Think-aloud pair problem-solving is particularly effective in promoting problem-solving skills, as it provides a structured approach to help students break down complex problems into manageable parts and develop effective strategies for addressing them.\n\nIn addition to promoting critical thinking and problem-solving skills, think-aloud pair problem-solving also fosters collaboration, communication, and teamwork. It encourages students to work together, listen to each other, and build upon each other's ideas to arrive at a solution.\n\nOverall, think-aloud pair problem-solving is a powerful teaching technique that can help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, foster collaboration and communication, and improve learning outcomes.",

      "response": "To create an Ubuntu package for a Python script that includes dependencies installed via pip, you will need to do the following:\n\n1. Create a new directory for your package and move into it.\n2. Create a `setup.py` file that includes information about your package and its dependencies.\n3. Install your package and its dependencies using pip.\n4. Create a `DEBIAN` directory in the root of your package directory.\n5. Create a `control` file in the `DEBIAN` directory, which specifies metadata about your package, such as its name, version, and dependencies.\n6. Create a `postinst` script in the `DEBIAN` directory, which will be run after your package is installed. This script can be used to set up your package, such as creating symbolic links or modifying system files.\n7. Run `dpkg-deb` to create the package file.\n\nHere is an example `setup.py` file:\n```\nfrom setuptools import setup\n\nsetup(\n    name='mypackage',\n    version='1.0',\n    install_requires=[\n        'dependency1',\n        'dependency2',\n    ],\n    packages=['mypackage'],\n    entry_points={\n        'console_scripts': [\n            'mypackage = mypackage.__main__:main'\n        ]\n    }\n)\n```\nThis `setup.py` file specifies the name and version of your package, as well as the dependencies that should be installed via pip. It also specifies the packages included in your package and the entry points for any console scripts.\n\nTo install your package and its dependencies using pip, run the following command:\n```\npip install .\n```\nThis will install your package and its dependencies in the current directory.\n\nNext, create the `DEBIAN` directory and the `control` file. The `control` file should contain the following information:\n```\nPackage: mypackage\nVersion: 1.0\nArchitecture: all\nMaintainer: Your Name <your@email.com>\nDescription: My package description\nDepends: python3, python3-pip, dependency1, dependency2\n```\nThis file specifies the name, version, and dependencies of your package.\n\nFinally, create a `postinst` script in the `DEBIAN` directory. This script can be used to set up your package after it is installed. For example, you might want to create symbolic links or modify system files.\n\nOnce you have created the `setup.py` file, installed your package and dependencies using pip, and created the `DEBIAN` directory and its contents, you can use `dpkg-deb` to create the package file. Run the following command:\n```\ndpkg-deb --build mypackage\n```\nThis will create a `.deb` package file in the current directory. You can then install the package on an Ubuntu system using `dpkg` or `apt`.\n```\nsudo dpkg -i mypackage.deb\n```\nor\n```\nsudo apt install ./mypackage.deb\n```",

The balance struck between these distinct elements is nothing short of masterful \u2013 a testament to the artistic prowess of both Arno & DJ Speep.\n\nThe track's production quality is superb, with each layer melding seamlessly into the next. At times, the beats are punchy and unapologetic; at others, they're stripped back and restrained, allowing the listener to truly appreciate the vast array of textures and sounds that \"Sundown\" has to offer.\n\nIn an era where electronic music often favors homogeneity over ingenuity, \"Sundown\" is a breath of fresh air. Its blend of pulsing rhythms, enthralling synth work, and haunting vocals coalesce to form a truly captivating experience. This auditory excursion rewards those who venture deep into its depths, and the journey is nothing short of spellbinding.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Sundown EP has set the stage for Arno & DJ Speep to make a lasting impact on the electronic music scene. \"Sundown\" is not just a track; it's an invitation to explore the uncharted territories of sound, a testament to the duo's unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of their craft.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Sundown\" is a masterclass in electronic music production, a kaleidoscopic journey that defies convention and leaves a lasting impression on all who dare to embark upon it. Arno & DJ Speep have crafted something truly special, and it's a journey you won't want to miss.\n\n---",

Some people argue that countries should limit their food imports and primarily consume products from their own country. From my perspective, I disagree with this notion.\n\nOne significant reason why countries should not limit food imports is that it restricts the availability of a diverse range of food items. With the advent of globalization, people have become more inclined to consume food items from different parts of the world. Imposing such a restriction would deprive people of the opportunity to relish exotic and diverse cuisines. It would also limit the economic growth of a country by reducing the scope of trade with other nations.\n\nAnother reason why limiting food imports is not viable is that it could lead to food scarcity. With the increasing global population, it has become challenging for countries to produce enough food to sustain their people's needs. Limiting food imports could lead to food shortages, which would have a significant impact on people's health and well-being. It could also lead to a rise in food prices, making it difficult for low-income families to afford basic necessities.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that countries should not limit their food imports and should continue to consume a diverse range of food items from all over the world.

But in quantum computing, a qubit can exist in both 0 and 1 states simultaneously, known as a superposition. This means that quantum computers can process a vast number of possibilities simultaneously, making them much faster than classical computers for certain types of problems.\n\nAdditionally, quantum computing utilizes a phenomenon called entanglement, where two qubits can be linked in such a way that the state of one affects the state of the other, even if they're separated by great distances. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers could ever hope to achieve.\n\nQuantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, drug discovery, and even climate modeling. However, building and programming quantum computers is still a very challenging task, and there's a long way to go before they become practical for everyday use.",

      "response": "To convert a wireframe into a UI with a specific style using neural networks, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. Collect and label a dataset of UI designs that match the desired style. This dataset will be used to train the neural network.\n2. Train a generative model, such as a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), on the labeled dataset. The goal of the model is to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between wireframes and their corresponding UIs.\n3. Use the trained model to generate new UI designs based on a given wireframe. You can provide the wireframe as an input to the network, and the network will generate the corresponding UI.\n4. Refine and iterate on the generated UI designs until you get the desired look and feel. You can adjust the network's parameters, add more data to the training set, or use another model architecture to achieve better results.\n\nNote that this process requires a good understanding of deep learning and a significant amount of technical expertise.

Keep in mind that the project contains the frontend UI and database queries also contain stored procedures and triggers.\n\nin my mind I make a farm management system so, suggest me how I can add all these things in my project",
      "response": "A farm management system sounds like an interesting and practical project idea for your semester project in Introduction to the database. Here are some suggestions on how you can incorporate the required elements:\n\n1. Frontend UI: For the frontend UI, you can create a user-friendly interface for farmers and farm managers to interact with the system. You can include features like a dashboard to view key performance indicators, data visualization, and data entry forms for adding and updating farm-related data. Additionally, you can make use of modern frontend frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build your frontend.\n2. Database Design: A good database design is essential for any database project. You can start by identifying the entities and relationships that exist in a farm management system, like farms, farmers, crops, livestock, equipment, and vendors. From there, you can create a logical data model that describes the structure and relationships between these entities. This will help you determine the tables, columns, and data types required for your database.\n3. Database Queries: As part of your project, you will need to write SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from the database. You can include queries for generating reports, searching for specific data, and analyzing trends in the data. You can also make use of database features like joins, aggregations, and subqueries to make your queries more powerful.\n4. Stored Procedures: Stored procedures are precompiled database programs that can be executed on demand. You can create stored procedures to perform complex database operations like data validation, calculation, and transformation. For example, you can create a stored procedure to calculate the average yield of a crop based on historical data.\n5. Triggers: Triggers are database objects that automatically execute in response to specific events, like data modification. You can create triggers to enforce data integrity rules, perform auditing, and update related data automatically. For example, you can create a trigger that updates the inventory of a specific crop when a new harvest is added to the system.\n\nOverall, your farm management system can include features like farm management, crop management, livestock management, equipment management, vendor management, and reporting. With these suggestions in mind, you can create a comprehensive and useful system that integrates all the required elements for your semester project in Introduction to the database.",

      "prompt": "Write an essay reflecting on the ideas presented in \"The Moving Body\" by Jacques LeCoq",
      "response": "In \"The Moving Body,\" Jacques LeCoq presents a philosophy of physical theater that is centered on the idea that the body is a tool for expression and communication. LeCoq believes that the body is capable of conveying complex emotions and ideas through movement, and that this movement can be trained and developed through specific exercises and techniques.\n\nOne of the key ideas that LeCoq discusses is the concept of the \"score,\" or the series of movements and actions that make up a physical performance. According to LeCoq, the score is not simply a set of predetermined movements, but rather a dynamic and flexible structure that allows for improvisation and exploration. This approach to the score emphasizes the importance of the body's ability to respond to the present moment, rather than simply following a preconceived script.\n\nLeCoq also stresses the importance of play and imagination in the development of physical theater. He believes that the body is at its most expressive and creative when it is allowed to move freely and spontaneously, and that this freedom is essential for the actor to fully inhabit their role. This emphasis on play and imagination is also reflected in LeCoq's approach to training, which involves a variety of exercises and games designed to encourage creativity and physical expression.\n\nAnother key idea that LeCoq presents is the concept of the \"body-mind,\" or the idea that the body and the mind are interconnected and inseparable. For LeCoq, the body is not simply a vessel for the mind, but rather an integral part of the thinking process itself. This idea is reflected in his approach to acting, which emphasizes the importance of the body in conveying emotions and ideas, rather than simply relying on words and dialogue.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Moving Body\" presents a rich and thought-provoking philosophy of physical theater that is centered on the body as a tool for expression and communication. LeCoq's ideas about the score, play, and the body-mind offer valuable insights into the art of acting and the power of movement to convey complex emotions and ideas.",

Help William count how many pizza restaurants can his phone book contain at the most! Input The first line contains one integer: N, the number of phone numbers in William\u2019s phone book. Each of the next N lines contain one phone number P\\_i. Output You need to write a single line containing a single integer: the answer to the problem. Each phone number is between 8 and 15 characters long.",
      "response": "To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the input values:\n* The first value, N, is the number of phone numbers in William's phone book.\n* The next N lines contain the phone numbers, P\\_i.\n2. Loop through the phone numbers and check if the phone number is Italian:\n* If the phone number starts with \"+39\" and has between 9 and 10 digits (excluding the country code), it is considered an Italian phone number.\n3. Count the number of Italian phone numbers and print the result.\n\nHere is a possible pseudocode for this solution:\n```\n# Read the number of phone numbers, N\nN = read_input()\n\n# Initialize a counter for the number of Italian phone numbers\ncount = 0\n\n# Loop through the phone numbers\nfor i in range(N):\n  # Read the phone number\n  phone_number = read_input()\n\n  # Check if the phone number is Italian\n  if phone_number starts with \"+39\" and has between 9 and 10 digits (excluding the country code):\n    # If the phone number is Italian, increment the counter\n    count = count + 1\n\n# Print the result\nprint(count)\n```",

Provide a detailed recap of each part of the sales call transcript to help the sales manager gain a complete detailed understanding of the deal. Use a sales framework. \n\nTranscript part 2 (10m28s-20m4s our of 29m02s):\n\n\"10m 28s Matt Brown Alternatively though if, you do want to make those public, you certainly can and you can distill them all the way down to ICI roles and and what those activities are going to look like for each of those contributors and how those will roll up into those larger department and company wide objectives.\n10m 47s Matt Brown From an editing standpoint as well. We can clearly separate the customer facing, say, sales, for example.\n10m 55s Matt Brown The sales goals can only be managed and edited by the sales team, even though there is visibility from other departments.\n11m 3s Matt Brown Same with finance, same with people ops. So you can have that clear separation in terms of who's owning it and who is updating and keeping track of those.\n11m 14s Matt Brown OKRs.\n11m 14s Matt Brown But the the visibility in terms of seeing what the other teams are doing, you certainly have that and we allow for that.\n11m 25s Matt Brown I know you probably haven't seen this part just yet, but our fellows onboarding support will help the senior leaders who are owning the OKR functionality, the tracking, and get them trained up, confident, comfortable using the tool, but also work with them to import the the OKR that you're currently tracking.\n11m 46s Matt Brown Does that answer your question? Yeah. And I'm\n11m 49s Nick Sarkesian assuming on top of all of this, individuals are able to just go in there and set goals for themselves and all that as well.\n11m 57s Nick Sarkesian Right. Though we haven't yet\n12m 0s Matt Brown built it out for like the end user level and I'll show you why.\n12m 3s Matt Brown So why we built it You. know, thinking from the top down perspective is that for managers they can embed those one to ones within their 1 to 1 specific objectives assigned to those key individuals.\n12m 18s Matt Brown So instead of having again another, place for those icis or front level managers to check and constantly keep track of, we can embed those.\n12m 32s Matt Brown Those OKRs directly within your meeting templates.\n12m 36s Matt Brown So as you begin to standardize the way that a rive runs your one to ones, each manager can then import and pull through the objectives that they're going to discuss with each of their reports.\n12m 51s Matt Brown So it makes it a lot more actionable. Scott. Yeah. Looks great. Is\n12m 57s Eric Cameron there a way when you assign action items to people that as a manager you can see them what you've assigned? I know it shows like your own action items, but is there a way to see action items you've assigned to others?\n13m 10s Eric Cameron So there isn't like\n13m 11s Matt Brown a God mode, so to speak. The best way I would recommend, though, is as a participant in those other meetings, you do have visibility into it.\n13m 21s Matt Brown So I'll create an action item here, sign it to myself. You can see already just by creating one an action items tab has one appeared and two taken.\n13m 33s Matt Brown Note that there's an outstanding action item. Let's say revise report.\n13m 39s Matt Brown So what you can do quickly for any of the managers or the ICS as well is this action items tab will provide a list of all of the action items that have been assigned throughout the the history of this meeting.\n13m 56s Matt Brown For team meetings. You can also assign organize it rather by assigning, which helps to write. You can see what everybody's bandwidth is like.\n14m 6s Matt Brown Sounds good. I think\n14m 9s Eric Cameron at some point a greater training on all of the features and things would be great, so we don't have to dive too much into that I guess.\n14m 15s Eric Cameron A couple other just like high level tactical questions. You mentioned analytics and reporting. Do admins have visibility into any one on one content?\n14m 28s Eric Cameron And I don't want them to. So I'm just asking like let's say Nick is an admin of the entire system.\n14m 35s Eric Cameron Does he just have the ability to see analytics of who's meeting or does he have the ability to see what was actually listed in those one on one?\n14m 45s Eric Cameron Good question. So it is\n14m 47s Matt Brown secure.\n14m 48s Matt Brown Any team member with admin powers, they'd be able to see an overview of what those meetings are and but not like specific.\n14m 58s Matt Brown So for example if, there was maybe an issue arise between a manager and a report. No admin nor any other member of the workspace is able to backdoor their way into that.\n15m 13s Matt Brown Okay. The analytics are really clearly showing what that meeting health looks like. So what meetings that started with an agenda ended with notes.\n15m 24s Matt Brown No meeting or no agenda. No notes. So you can see here you're getting a high level overview of of those metrics. Also meeting hours over the last 60 days, you can filter it through 30 days as well or 90 for the entire quarter.\n15m 40s Matt Brown So we do want to make these actionable and with the the feedback loop here closed from there, you can internally provide that additional support or or alternatively, Fellow does have that ongoing support.\n15m 57s Matt Brown So for managers and senior management, we can provide 1 to 1 sessions for end users or closer to the front line managers.\n16m 8s Matt Brown We have team sessions as well.\n16m 10s Matt Brown So the, the training and the the adoption of Fellow doesn't rest solely on the shoulders of the the business owner or any team members directly tied to the the rollout of Fellow as well.\n16m 25s Matt Brown Sounds good. And then I imagine we can look\n16m 27s Eric Cameron at this at like a managerial level as well, to say which managers are using it, which are not that type of detail. Yes, exactly.\n16m 35s Eric Cameron So you can double click\n16m 37s Matt Brown into members. Let's pull up that here. There you can see Matt. Alternatively. Or Matt and then it's also days active meetings attended.\n16m 53s Matt Brown And then for those users who also have direct reports, you can toggle include reports. So then you can see the dropdown of hey match map using it pretty effectively.\n17m 4s Matt Brown But his direct reports, Elaine and George might not be getting the same level of support and love.\n17m 11s Matt Brown So Matt needs some additional training in terms of how do we bring Fellow that one level down to the direct reports to make sure that they're getting the most out of their 1 to 1 calls as well.\n17m 23s Matt Brown Okay. Sounds great. That all looks good. And\n17m 26s Eric Cameron then I noticed on the Enterprise list that JIRA was listed as an integration How. does that integration works? We do definitely Some. of our teams, especially the IT team, utilizes JIRA.\n17m 39s Eric Cameron No, that was\n17m 40s Matt Brown that was also something that Tyler and Alex brought up So. our JIRA integration is really, really powerful I. think you're going to like it.\n17m 47s Matt Brown So for action items, I know it's synched with our Asana board right now, so you can automatically assign it, link it to Asana with our JIRA integration.\n18m 0s Matt Brown You can set this up and post directly to a project or alternatively, because it is two way. We can import something directly from Asana as well.\n18m 13s Matt Brown So for those more technical conversations where you're maybe doing a project check in or status update, having this all within Fellow just eliminates the the time spent double clicking in.\n18m 28s Matt Brown Where are we at on this? A quick update. Leave yourself open to tangents as well. Instead having these all sync directly within.\n18m 39s Matt Brown Fellow to JIRA, you can quickly roll through all of those those outstanding tasks or those completed tasks as well. Nice.\n18m 50s Matt Brown Are you. Are you\n18m 51s Nick Sarkesian able to turn an action item into a ticket? So you see here.\n19m 0s Matt Brown As of right now, it's more of like a to do, but then you can double click in and link and issue.\n19m 8s Matt Brown I can get you a little bit more information on like the total extent of our JIRA integration, especially for those technical teams.\n19m 15s Nick Sarkesian But the idea is, is just to like eliminate\n19m 18s Matt Brown the amount of friction between hopping from your your, meeting agenda and Fellow to to running it in JIRA. Right? Yeah. Cool.\n19m 30s Nick Sarkesian So that's a bit of a snapshot\n19m 32s Matt Brown in terms of of the Fellow capabilities. It sounded like somebody did have a question there as well. I have one last question from\n19m 41s Eric Cameron a pricing perspective, which if you can send me those details after the fact that'd, be great. How does that work? Is that all invited users were charged or is it just active within the system?\n19m 55s Eric Cameron So I'm just thinking we have, let's say, 1700 employees right now. If we take\n20m 1s Matt Brown it to everybody through October, technically 1700\n20m 4s Eric Cameron people have access to it, if only 500 people are actively using it. How does pricing work from those perspectives? Yeah, you raise a really good question\"",
      "response": "Recap of Transcript Part 2 (10m28s-20m4s):\n\nIn this section of the sales call, Matt Brown further discusses the OKR functionality, highlighting visibility and editing permissions. He explains that the platform allows for clear separation of ownership, with different departments only able to edit their own OKRs. Visibility across departments, however, is maintained. He also shares details about Fellow's onboarding support for senior leaders and the import of existing OKRs.\n\nMatt then moves on to discuss how objectives can be embedded within one-to-one meetings and meeting templates, making it more actionable for managers and their direct reports. Eric Cameron asks about visibility of assigned action items and Matt confirms that while there isn't a \"God mode,\" participants in meetings can see action items assigned to them.\n\nFollowing this, Matt provides a brief overview of the platform's analytics and reporting features, emphasizing that the content of one-on-one meetings remains secure and only an overview of meetings is visible to admins. He also shares information about meeting health metrics and available training options.\n\nWhen Eric asks about analytics at the managerial level, Matt demonstrates how the platform can provide insights into usage by managers and their direct reports. He also discusses the JIRA integration, highlighting its two-way functionality, which can help eliminate friction between meeting agendas and JIRA.\n\nLastly, Eric raises a pricing question about whether all invited users or only active users are charged. Matt acknowledges that it's an important question, implying that he will provide more information after the call.",

      "prompt": "When the Avatar dies, the Avatar spirit is reincarnated into the next element in the cycle. With Aang's death, he would be reborn as a water bender. In the canon timeline of course, that's Korra, and we can reuse some aspects of her character to save ourselves the trouble of coming up with a new one. But, this version of Korra would still be very different from the one we know. For one thing, she would be born many years earlier, because of Aang's earlier death. For another, she would be born into a world ruled by the Fire Nation, in a Water Tribe that's either recently conquered or on the verge of being conquered. And finally, she would be taking up the mantle of the Avatar in a world with no living Airbenders to teach her, and no clear hope of ever fulfilling her potential as the Avatar.\n\nWhat do you think this version of Korra would be like?",
      "response": "This version of Korra would certainly face a unique set of challenges and circumstances that would shape her personality and worldview. Being born into a world dominated by the Fire Nation, she would likely be exposed to their propaganda and ideology from a young age, which could potentially influence her beliefs about the other nations and the Avatar's role in the world.\n\nWithout any living Airbenders to teach her, she would likely struggle to master the spiritual and philosophical aspects of Airbending, which could lead to a sense of frustration and inadequacy. This could manifest in a brash and impulsive personality, as she tries to compensate for her perceived weaknesses in other areas.\n\nGrowing up in a Water Tribe that's recently conquered or on the verge of being conquered would also add a layer of trauma and bitterness to her experiences. She may harbor a deep-seated anger towards the Fire Nation and a desire to avenge her people, which could drive her actions as the Avatar.\n\nOverall, this version of Korra would likely be a complex and conflicted character, shaped by her unique circumstances and struggling to come to terms with her role as the Avatar in a world that's vastly different from the one Aang knew.",

      "prompt": "Explain how to use mqtt publisher subscriber on rpi 4 device\nSupport answer with python code",
      "response": "MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol used for communicating between devices in IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It uses a publisher-subscriber model where a publisher sends messages to a topic, and subscribers receive messages from topics they are subscribed to.\n\nTo use MQTT on an RPi 4 device, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. Install the Eclipse Paho MQTT Python client library:\n```\npip install paho-mqtt\n```\n1. Import the `paho.mqtt.client` module and create a `Client` instance:\n```python\nimport paho.mqtt.client as mqtt\n\nclient = mqtt.Client()\n```\n1. Connect to the MQTT broker. In this example, we will use the publicly available MQTT test broker at `test.mosquitto.org`:\n```python\nbroker_address = \"test.mosquitto.org\"\nclient.connect(broker_address)\n```\n1. Publish a message to a topic:\n```python\ntopic = \"test/topic\"\nmessage = \"Hello, world!\"\nclient.publish(topic, message)\n```\n1. Subscribe to a topic and receive messages:\n```python\ndef on_message(client, userdata, message):\n    print(f\"Received message '{message.payload.decode()}' on topic '{message.topic}'\")\n\ntopic = \"test/topic\"\nclient.subscribe(topic)\nclient.on_message = on_message\nclient.loop_forever()\n```\nThe `on_message` function is called whenever a message is received on the subscribed topic. The `loop_forever` function runs an infinite loop, listening for incoming messages.\n\nHere is the full example code:\n```python\nimport paho.mqtt.client as mqtt\n\nbroker_address = \"test.mosquitto.org\"\ntopic = \"test/topic\"\nmessage = \"Hello, world!\"\n\ndef on_message(client, userdata, message):\n    print(f\"Received message '{message.payload.decode()}' on topic '{message.topic}'\")\n\nclient = mqtt.Client()\nclient.connect(broker_address)\nclient.subscribe(topic)\nclient.on_message = on_message\nclient.publish(topic, message)\nclient.loop_forever()\n```\nWhen you run this code, it will publish a message to the `test/topic` topic and then subscribe to that topic to receive the message. The `on_message` function will print the received message to the console.",

Now we get to talk about the spine\u2014the bones and discs\u2014which is actually the foundation upon which your body is built. The keel of your boat, or however you want to think of it. And its extraordinary gift is that, unlike the keel of your boat or the foundation of your house, it is flexible. Actually, it is better than that: It is rigid, much of the time. Which allows you to sit and stand upright and be stable, even under great pressure, while the hips and shoulders allow you to move and perform tasks. But it can also bend, forward and back and from side to side, when you need it to do that. And even twist a little. Amazing. It is \u201carticulated\u201d like a linked chain. Which is to say, it is made up of a bunch of pieces and they let you flex. The individual pieces are the bones, called vertebrae\u2014some thirty-three of them\u2014stacked on top of each other with semisoft shock absorbers or \u201cdiscs\u201d in between them. The spine is divided into sections based on the curvature of the spine in each section. The four sections are the cervical spine (neck), thoracic spine (upper and mid back), lumbar spine (lower back), and sacrum and coccyx (tailbone). Different nerves stem out of the spine at different places and go on to regulate specific parts of your body. This may interest me more than most, but that\u2019s why, if you break your back and damage your spine up high, almost all the nerves are affected and almost nothing \u201cworks\u201d\u2014you are apt to be a quadriplegic. If the damage happens lower down, your upper body works okay, but you can\u2019t walk. If it happens really high on your neck, you can\u2019t breathe; you\u2019re on a respirator. \nAll the bones in the spine are movable and have discs in between them except the sacrum and coccyx, which are fused or sealed together (no discs for them, of course). The discs, which we\u2019ll come to in a moment, are, according to Jeremy, \u201cmade up of a fibrous outer layer, which resists fraying or breaking under normal conditions, and an inner liquid core called the nucleus pulposus, which gives the discs the ability to distribute loads evenly throughout the discs and resist compressive forces.\u201d I like to think of them as very tough jelly doughnuts: They are tough on the outside and have goo or jelly on the inside, so they can give with pressure and rebound. They can be compressed, angled, and so on, but not endlessly. We\u2019ll come back to that in a moment. Abused or bulging discs can hurt like crazy. Ruptured discs are much worse.\nHere is an important home truth. The whole spine is articulated but not to the same degree. Most urgently, your lower or lumbar spine\u2014the area that most often gets messed up\u2014isn\u2019t meant to handle loads in flexed or rotated positions. Do those words make any sense to you? What they mean, in the end, is Don\u2019t bend, lift, and twist with your lower back. There. That is one of the most important lessons in the book. Your lumbar spine is designed to hold you up, almost as if it were fused. We need to have some movement in there, but not much, and certainly not with loads, especially repetitive loads. The little muscles around it are meant to keep it stable, not to lift things, and so on.\nPut it this way, as if it came from the Decalogue: Thou shalt not rotate with thy lower back. Rotate with your hips, not your lower back. How do you rotate with your hips instead of your lower back? Easy. We will show you. \nThe Vertebrae\n\nTHE HOLY GRAIL \nAgain, we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves, but the simple picture above shows the neutral spine position. That\u2019s the Holy Grail in this book\u2014maintaining a neutral spine. This is the way you want to carry yourself, almost all the time. Jeremy will talk about it in greater detail, but this is the safest, strongest, and most effective way to carry yourself and support loads. It may be a slight surprise, but \u201cstanding up straight\u201d does not mean your neutral or ideal spine is straight: it is a series of natural curves. Why? Who knows. Ask a structural engineer, preferably a suspension bridge builder. What I have learned from Jeremy (and Bill, before him) is that this is the ideal, and it is worth going to a tremendous amount of trouble to get into the habit of carrying yourself in this position.I now think about it all the time\u2014sitting, walking, riding my bike, in spin class\u2014all the time. I can feel it, when I am in the right posture; it feels good. And, it turns out, that\u2019s a blessing. If you take good care of your neutral spine, it will go very far indeed toward taking care of you. \nIT\u2019S HOLLOW!",

Here's a formula that you can use to search for a specific value in a column, row, or date and return a summary:\n```\n=SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])\n```\nHere's what each of the parameters does:\n\n* `range`: This is the range of cells that you want to search. It can be a single column, a single row, or a range of cells.\n* `criteria`: This is the value that you want to search for in the range. It can be a specific text string, a number, or a date.\n* `[sum_range]`: This is the range of cells that you want to sum. It should be the same size as the range parameter. If you omit this parameter, the formula will sum all cells in the range.\n\nFor example, let's say that you have a table with the following data:\n\n|  | A | B | C | D |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Date | Sales | Cost | Profit |\n| 2 | 1/1/2022 | 100 | 50 | 50 |\n| 3 | 1/2/2022 | 200 | 100 | 100 |\n| 4 | 1/3/2022 | 300 | 150 | 150 |\n| 5 | 1/4/2022 | 400 | 200 | 200 |\n\nTo search for the sales on a specific date and return the sum, you could use the following formula:\n```\n=SUMIF(A2:A5, \"1/2/2022\", B2:B5)\n```\nThis formula would search the range A2:A5 for the value \"1/2/2022\", and then return the sum of the cells in the range B2:B5 that correspond to the matching cells in A2:A5. In this case, the formula would return 200.\n\nYou can also use wildcards in the criteria parameter to search for a partial match. For example, the following formula would return the sum of all sales in January:\n```\n=SUMIF(A2:A5, \"1/*/2022\", B2:B5)\n```\nI hope this helps!

      "prompt": "CHAPTER THIRTEEN\n RULE #5\n Use the Power in Your Posterior\n From Jeremy\nPossibly the most overlooked bit of anatomy, for back pain, is your backside. We are talking about your butt and especially your glutes, the big muscles that constitute most of your butt. The difficulty is that, in modern times, we have mostly used our glutes to sit on. They have atrophied as a result. The use of the buttocks exclusively as a seat cushion is a recent development in evolutionary terms, and a rotten one. It is handy, lord knows, but that wasn\u2019t the original design idea, and we are paying a horrendous price for it, mostly in back pain. \nLetting your glutes go to hell in idleness (\u201cgluteal amnesia,\u201d as the great student of back pain Dr. Stuart McGill called it) is an absolutely dreadful idea. By all means, continue to sit on them. But do much, much more, too. Remember that the glutes are the biggest muscles in your body, they have serious loads to bear, and it is critical that we let them do it. Because, if we don\u2019t, our spines (and the tiny muscles around them) will carry those loads, and they are not designed for it. They protest . . . they hurt. And they will continue to hurt until you wake up your glutes and let them do their job. \nThe gluteal muscles are a group of three muscles that make up the buttocks. There are several smaller muscles back there as well, including the piriformis. They look like this (see diagram below). \nIn a healthy person, the gluteal muscles perform a bunch of important functions. Here\u2019s what they should be doing: \n\u2022 helping you to stand up and maintain erect posture \n\u2022 keeping you from falling forward when you walk or run \n\u2022 keeping your pelvis from collapsing when you are standing on one leg or walking when only one foot is in contact with the ground \n\u2022 helping you to rise from a seated position \n\u2022 helping you pick things up \n\u2022 helping you climb stairs, ski, run, row\u2014and that old favorite, make love\nGluteal Muscles\n\nAll kinds of things. Obviously, these are some of the most important things you do and these are some of the most important muscles in your body. \nWhen you let your glutes go to sleep, things get bad. They \u201cforget\u201d all those critical functions, and the muscles that take up the slack are not up to the job. As we compress the muscles (by sitting on them), nerves and blood vessels in the gluteal muscle don\u2019t work as well. Our brain literally loses its connectivity with them. The muscles, and the neural pathways, atrophy (or \u201close preference\u201d); the brain \u201cforgets\u201d them. Hence, the term gluteal amnesia. In my experience, there is a very high correlation between the glutes going to sleep and back pain. Very high.\nHere\u2019s why: When those big powerful muscles aren\u2019t doing their job, the spine takes over. It bears the brunt of the forces that the glutes are supposed to be handling and it gets overwhelmed and damaged. Instead of using those big muscles to do things like pick up your child or grandchild, you first use the tiny muscles around your spine to do them, and those muscles can\u2019t handle it. They become strained (which causes pain, all by itself) and eventually fail. Then things get quite a bit worse. When those little muscles fail, the forces that your glutes were supposed to be handling get transmitted directly onto your discs, joints, ligaments, and tendons. That is not what they are supposed to do and it causes serious problems. Conversely, those big psoas muscles get reflexively tighter, putting more pressure on the spine. Think about it: Every time you get out of a chair, pick something up, tie your shoe, or climb the stairs, you are putting a ton of pressure on your spine that it is not designed to bear. You can do it for a while. You can do almost anything for a while. But over the days, months, and years, these micro irritations add up to macro damage. Remember Chris\u2019s explanation of \u201cgeologic time\u201d? Mountains are ground down to rubble in geologic time. Your spine is ground down to rubble in your own version of geologic time, if your glutes don\u2019t do their job.\nSummary: Letting your glutes go to sleep is a terrible idea. Reversing that process and waking them up is crucial to healing back pain. Once those muscles wake up and start doing their intended work, the muscles that do the opposite motion on the joint, the psoas muscles, reflexively loosen up. If you didn\u2019t know this, don\u2019t feel bad. A lot of therapists and doctors don\u2019t know it, either. Or don\u2019t treat it effectively. Teaching you how to treat the problem effectively is one of the most important things we do in this book. \nHere\u2019s what you need to do, in three steps: Wake up your glutes, make them strong, and learn to use them at the appropriate times, as they were designed to be used. \nPART ONE: WAKING UP THE SLEEPING GIANTS\nYou tried using your glutes with the bridge exercise. Now let\u2019s try a different way to wake them up. If you had trouble with the bridge, don\u2019t worry. We will come back to that shortly. \nClamshell\nNow, on to the all-important \u201cclamshell\u201d exercise. It is critical\u2014boring and often poorly performed, but it wakes up and strengthens your glutes.\nStep 1: Lie on your side with your hips and knees bent as shown.\nStep 2: Take the thumb of your top hand and dig it inside your upper hip bone, as in the drawing. \nStep 3: Lay the four fingers of that hand across the outside of your hip, as in the picture. \nStep 4: For most of you, your middle finger (or first or third) will be lying right on the gluteal muscles we are trying to wake up. Poke your fingers in there and feel them. Reestablish that connection with your brain. Keep your fingers there.\n\nStep 5: Find your neutral spine and brace your core.",

The duration of the test is then used to estimate VO2max.\n\nThe formula for estimating VO2max based on the Bruce treadmill test is as follows:\n\nVO2max\u00a0(ml/kg/min)=14.76\u2212(1.379\u00d7T)+(0.451\u00d7T2)\u2212(0.012\u00d7T3)\\text{VO2max (ml/kg/min)} = 14.76 - (1.379 \\times T) + (0.451 \\times T^2) - (0.012 \\times T^3)VO2max\u00a0(ml/kg/min)=14.76\u2212(1.379\u00d7T)+(0.451\u00d7T2)\u2212(0.012\u00d7T3)Where:\n\n* VO2max is the maximal oxygen uptake in milliliters per kilogram per minute (ml/kg/min).\n* T is the total time (in minutes) that the participant was able to run on the treadmill before reaching exhaustion.\n\nIf you have data from a treadmill run, such as the total time (T) that you were able to run before reaching exhaustion, you can use this formula to estimate your VO2max. Please provide the total time (T) in minutes, and I can calculate your estimated VO2max for you.",

      "prompt": "are there examples of terraform providers that have built their code atop of other providers? for example, we have a service that deploys VMs in AWS? Can we leverage the AWS Provider in Terraform for that?",
      "response": "Yes, it's possible to build custom Terraform providers that leverage existing providers. A custom provider can wrap or extend another provider to offer additional functionality or adapt to a specific use case. In your case, if you have a service that deploys VMs in AWS, you can build a custom provider that uses the AWS provider under the hood.\n\nHere's an example of how you might approach this:\n\n1. Use the AWS provider as a dependency: In your custom provider code, you would import the AWS provider as a dependency. This allows you to leverage its functionality for creating and managing AWS resources.\n2. Define your custom provider schema: You would define your custom provider's schema to include the necessary configuration parameters and resources specific to your use case. You can choose to expose some of the AWS provider's functionality directly or create higher-level abstractions that simplify the interface for your users.\n3. Implement CRUD operations: For each resource defined in your custom provider, you would implement the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. In these operations, you can call the appropriate functions from the AWS provider to create and manage the underlying AWS resources.\n4. Register and distribute your custom provider: Once your custom provider is complete, you would need to register it with Terraform and distribute it to your users, either privately or through the Terraform Registry.\n\nHere's a high-level example of how your custom provider code might look in Go:\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n  \"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/schema\"\n  \"github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/plugin\"\n  \"github.com/yourcustomprovider/aws\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n  plugin.Serve(&plugin.ServeOpts{\n    ProviderFunc: func() *schema.Provider {\n      return &schema.Provider{\n        Schema:         aws.Provider().Schema,\n        ResourcesMap:   mergeResourceMaps(aws.Provider().ResourcesMap, customResourcesMap),\n        DataSourcesMap: mergeDataSourcesMaps(aws.Provider().DataSourcesMap, customDataSourcesMap),\n      }\n    },\n  })\n}\n\n// mergeResourceMaps and mergeDataSourcesMaps functions to merge resource and data source maps\n```\nRemember that Terraform providers are essentially wrappers around APIs, so you can leverage existing providers to interact with those APIs and build upon them to create custom functionality.",

In this example, there is one response variable called income. This is a binary feature with two possible values: \" <=50K\" or \" >50K\". Because thes values are not conventional binary values, i.e., \"True\" and \"False\", a feature specific preprocessing option is specified to indicate which string (\" >50K\") is interpreted as \"True\".

This increased demand results in more factories, dealerships, and related businesses, which can lead to higher employment rates and an overall positive impact on the economy.\n\nOn the other hand, the environmental impact of cars cannot be ignored. Cars contribute significantly to air pollution and global warming. The rise in car ownership has also led to increased traffic, which leads to longer commuting times and increased use of fossil fuels, which ultimately have a negative impact on the environment.\n\nThe decision to own and drive a car comes down to weighing the advantages and disadvantages. While car ownership can bring economic benefits, it should not come at the expense of the environment. Therefore, it is important for individuals and governments to consider alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or using public transportation, to mitigate the negative impact of cars on the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while car ownership can have positive impacts on the economy, it can also lead to negative consequences for the environment.

One of them will get it passed to one of the parents, and then just it just goes around like you said. But I'm really hoping 2023 is a year where we have like one week without anyone being sick.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 02:55\nSharing is caring.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 02:56\nMy kids are way older. My kids are 18. My daughter turned 18. Two weeks ago. And my son is 16. But it never changes. It's always the same scenario. Sharing is caring, and then they start blaming each other. Typical sibling site. Well, they're more social at that age, too.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 03:20\nSo it's easy to keep my fouryearold daughter at home if she's sick. But, you know, understand. I remember being 18, and it was a harder to keep me up in the house.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 03:29\nAbsolutely. Yeah. That's my situation right now. So we think we're getting better. And then two days later, we're down with this And it's really bad Cox and fevers and body aches. So it's a nasty, nasty viral that has definitely evolved into a superbug. That's what the doctors are seeing in Dubai as well. There was a news article yesterday that said the influenza. Bug has evolved into a superbug. So. Yep, it's fun. We're having a party hand by.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 04:01\nExciting times.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 04:06\nI was super excited after the last meeting. I love what Carry has to offer. Was even sharing that with Nathan. I love the analytics, I love the AI. Element to it as well. I love your dashboards. So exciting. So really looking forward to today as well.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 04:26\nOkay. Awesome. I'm glad to hear I didn't do a terrible job then. First some context. Curse is one of our solution engineers here as well. Lizzy. So. We can with curtain when Natan comes on as well, we can jump in or we can hold on for another couple of minutes. That's totally up to you, but we can start diving into some of the detail in specifically around. The consumption piece. I know that's an element to the business, but we can keep it pretty fluid as well. And if there's anything top of mind that you want to cover. Yeah. Do field questions, Curtis. Certainly the brains behind the operation here. So. You're well supported.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 05:12\nWhat I didn't see the last time, but I'm sure it's on clarity is like a Kp. dashboard. You know, apart from the Salesforce. That's. Then it's fantastic. There's also the Kpi dashboards that is currently. Managed manually. You know, in excel and with formulas. And then, of course, we recently converted those to Power Bi. But. Does clarity have. A version also that showcases. Like a scope of a comparative performance. Chart showing. Kpis. Kpi. Performance. Between each sales rep and then rolled up to the sales leader. There's something like that. On Clari.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 06:05\nSo. We can I suppose the short answer is yes, but requires a caveat that we would just need to understand specifically what it is that you're referring to. I think one thing that would be really helpful as well. At some point we can get a mutual mda in places, but just to get some visibility over the kpis that you're tracking and how you're visualizing that in excel. And in Power bi and we can see if it's that we can put together in a dashboard. I'm not sure karate have there's any additional context that you would kind of add there.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 06:38\nI think you nailed it. I mean, it's just about understanding what kpis are tracked. And there's probably several different ways we can support that. And Clari. The forecast module comes to mind where because you mentioned roll up. Right. So it's just understanding what formulas that you're using today, in which metrics that you're interested in tracking and then. Most of our customers, what they do is they'll have. Steven, I'm sure you let them know that in clarity you're not limited to one view of the forecast. So let's just say you have your sales global sales forecast in clarity. You could have a separate Kpi dashboard or Kpi based roll up where it's less about. Okay, well, what's the commit and upside, right?\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 07:24\nIt's more about here's the here of the sales reps and the frontline manager.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 07:28\nAnd maybe we're tracking asp's sales cycle link thing like things like that and rolling that.\n> \n\n> Lizy Thomson 07:36\nYou all of that. Yep. That's exactly what I'm talking about.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 07:39\nCool. I need to. Hey, guys.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 07:42\nHey, Stephen. Hey, cut. Sorry I got tied up on a on another call, which is actually about this. Let's get.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 07:51\nNo worries at all have you been. Yeah.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 07:53\nVery good. Thanks. Very good. How about yourself? Yeah. Keep them.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 07:56\nWell, thank you. Keep them well. I just thought I'd mention as well. I'm not sure if you saw the email came through, but I put together just an intro for yourself and Johnny from compliance. He just shared his calendar there. They've been a customer for a few years. By the way, similar stack to you. They use kaia and Outreach for top of funnel as well. They do.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 08:20\nInteresting. They they do use kaya.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:22\nYeah. I think they use Outreach for tapa funnel. And for kaya, they might even use it for more. But I think that's it and then Clarity for kind of forecasting, pipeline management, things like that. But Johnny is very familiar with the Clarity platform, so definitely a good person to speak to.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 08:38\nSure. Yeah. I'll try and connect with him this week. I saw you share this calendar there, so hopefully get a chance to sync up.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 08:44\nOkay. Cool. Well, if you need my help at all, just let me know. And yeah, outside of that and me curse and curse one of our solution engineers here. So as I was saying to Lizzie, there definitely the brains behind the operation between the two of us. So be good to kind of dive into some of the more. Yeah tactical and detail stuff around the forecasting especially consumption today.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:06\nAbsolutely nice to meet you. Hi, Nathan. Nice to meet you as well.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 09:11\nHow you doing. Yeah. Doing great, man. Doing great.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 09:15\nExcited. Use case here around your Usage product. Based in Philadelphia. I've been with Clari for about three years and typically focus on Enterprise forecasting, deployments. So we have had a couple customers come through with the consumption use case. And so Stephen tapped me to consult on what you guys are doing, so hopefully we can help you out with Larry.\n> \n\n> Stephen Donohoe 09:41\nTrust. So look, I suppose by way of an agenda for the call today, we've got another 35 minutes set aside and thought it'd best just to kind of keep this pretty conversational. I mean, we can potentially jump in and show you elements of clarity as well, if needs be. I suppose the most important thing is that we get a full understanding for how you're currently. I suppose. Forecasting and measuring, but also then hosting data around that consumption piece as well so that we can kind of go away and put together a couple of different options and see if we can find a solution that's going to work for you on that. So yeah, I suppose maybe over to you initially to just give a little bit of an overview. Maybe. Nathan, Lizzie around how you're currently reporting. On that consumption at the moment. And I'm sure Kurt will have a few questions as we go. Or unless Krista was something that you wanted to kind of kick off with.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 10:32\nNothing to present, but if we could start at a high level and just understand the gotomarket approach for that product. And then how you're reporting and forecasting on that that would be very helpful.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 10:47\nYeah, no problem. I'll have a swing at them. So the product in question is called Martrus. So it's. A Payments business. You can see it more as like a fintech play. Not too dissimilar to like revolute or Monzo or you know, some of these kind of popular. He kind of more ewlowerdriven solutions that you see nowadays. So the go to market approaches like our vertical. Across all of our products is within shipping. So when we talk about that, it's like. Transportation Companies that move product by see. On Large tanker, bulk vessels. Right. And so the Martros product is aimed at the seafarers, because that's where the volume is in terms of.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 11:40\nPersonnel.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 11:42\nSo here's what selling to a shipping company. Who are responsible for those seafarers onboard vessels. And really the. Kind of three main products that we would try and sell into a shipping company. One is. The Crew Payment solution. So.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:02\nEvery time you pay your seatbearer, which typically once a month.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:07\nAnd even any of your employees. But more typically, the seafarers is where the value proposition makes sense. We would basically charge you $12 flat on that transaction. Right. Because those seeds bearers are typically getting paid in local currency. So that's a once a month transaction. And then. And this is where it gets a little bit complex. So that's quite predictable. That's a beta B type cell, right. Every Cfare is going to get paid every month.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 12:40\nPretty.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 12:41\nThere's then a B to B to C element because of our E wallet solution, which is once you paid those cf errors, they can also take advantage of our E wallet solution. And that helps them send money back home to their families. Right. So if the Cfarer decides to take that up. Then we typically see another $1212. Plus a small amount of fx revenue. So you could say $15 on when they paid or when they make another bank to bank transfer, which is typically like one or two. It's normally one to family back home. Right. And then you have card usage, which is like point of sale atma type transactions on that card. But that's going to be like really small fx revenue, which is tiny.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 13:34\nBut.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 13:36\nIt does make up part of the like the revenue portfolio for ewallet, but again really difficult to forecast people use for it but just want to kind of paint the picture and then the other the other. Part the mantra solution is kind of like whilst we're talking to you, we could also handle your vendor payment. So when you pay vendors. It'll be a same same platform. Ultimately, what are we doing? We're making payments faster with fewer transaction fees. With a much better compliance platform kind of wrapped around it. And again, we're going to find around $15 there per transaction when they pay their customers. So the vendor payments is quite predictable. If the customer give us their volume. We know the fee that we're going to get per, you know, bank to make transfer.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:24\nThe crew payments is quite predictable.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:27\nI just need to know how many crew you got and just confirm you pay them once a month. Is really tricky because that's that B to be to C element. Like, how many times are they gonna send money back home per month. How many times are they going to do atm withdrawals? They're buy a packet cigarettes. So they're gonna go and buy like a new car. Like.\n> \n\n> Curt Weaver 14:53\nJust really difficult.\n> \n\n> Nathan Seldon 14:54\nAnd obviously we're making a few dollars on the fx as well every time they spend. And so, yeah, it's high. The average base that's highly, like. The challenge, as well as the ramp. So if you told me you've got 100 C fairs. Making. One payment, a month. $12 a month. That's quite easy for me to figure out what annually you're worth. Whatever. Right. But on the e wallet side. I don't know when your sea bearer is gonna choose to use it because they don't have to use it. No one can force them to use it if they don't want to. So like if you guys said, hey, we've got this amazing deal with revolution. If you use that card, you get all of these amazing perks. You might say I'm gonna stay with, like, Citibank. I'm not gonna use that. And so you're one less person that they have predicted that's just kind of dropped off, if that makes sense. But you never truly know when they're gonna drop off because there's no light optout or I want to say no. It's just like working with the accounts trying drive the doctrine. So as that ramp piece as well, which is which is which is tricky because we might say in accounts worth 100 grand and we sign them and we only find that within twelve months we found like 30 grand because we didn't get the adoption of the evolve.\"",

      "prompt": "Highlight and discuss two salient points or unique selling proposition of EV vehicles as compared to conventional vehicles, and why do you think EV can succeed in market penetration",
      "response": "There are several salient points or unique selling propositions (USPs) of electric vehicles (EVs) compared to conventional vehicles:\n\n1. Environmental benefits: One of the main reasons for the growing popularity of EVs is their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, which means they do not contribute to air pollution in the same way that gasoline-powered vehicles do. This is especially important in urban areas, where air pollution is often a significant concern.\n2. Cost savings: Another key advantage of EVs is their potential to save money on fuel costs. While the initial purchase price of an EV may be higher than that of a conventional vehicle, the lower cost of electricity compared to gasoline can result in significant savings over the life of the vehicle. In addition, many governments offer incentives and subsidies for the purchase of EVs, which can further reduce the upfront cost.\n\nThere are several reasons why EVs can succeed in market penetration:\n\n1. Increasing demand for sustainability: As awareness of environmental issues grows, there is increasing demand for more sustainable products and technologies, including EVs. This demand is likely to continue to grow as concerns about climate change and air pollution increase.\n2. Improving technology: The technology behind EVs is constantly improving, which means that they are becoming more efficient and cost-effective over time. As the technology improves, the range and performance of EVs is likely to increase, making them more appealing to a wider range of consumers.\n3. Government incentives: Many governments around the world are actively promoting the adoption of EVs through a variety of incentives and subsidies. These incentives can help to offset the higher upfront cost of EVs, making them more attractive to consumers.\n4. Growing charging infrastructure: The availability of charging infrastructure is an important factor in the adoption of EVs. As the number of charging stations increases, it becomes easier and more convenient for people to own and operate EVs, which can help to drive market penetration.",

      "prompt": "what are the best camera and lighting settings for YouTube when using the bmpcc 6k?",
      "response": "The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K (BMPCC 6K) is a powerful and versatile camera that can deliver excellent results for your YouTube videos. Here are some tips for achieving the best camera and lighting settings when using the BMPCC 6K:\n\n1. Resolution and Frame Rate:\nFor most YouTube content, shooting at 4K resolution (4096x2160 or 3840x2160) is a good choice, as it provides high-quality footage and is widely supported by streaming platforms. The frame rate depends on your content style. For standard videos, use 24 or 25 fps. For sports or fast-action content, consider 50 or 60 fps.\n2. Codec and Bitrate:\nUse Blackmagic RAW or ProRes 422 HQ for the best image quality. These codecs offer a good balance between file size and image quality. If storage space is a concern, ProRes 422 or ProRes LT can be used at the expense of slightly lower quality.\n3. ISO and Dynamic Range:\nThe BMPCC 6K has a dual native ISO (400 and 3200). Use ISO 400 for well-lit scenes and ISO 3200 for low-light situations. Utilize the camera's \"Film\" dynamic range setting to capture the maximum amount of detail in the highlights and shadows.\n4. White Balance:\nSet the white balance manually based on the color temperature of your lighting setup. You can also use the camera's built-in presets or the auto white balance feature. However, manual white balance will provide more accurate results.\n5. Shutter Angle:\nA 180-degree shutter angle is a standard choice for natural-looking motion blur. If you're shooting at 24 fps, set the shutter speed to 1/48 or 1/50. For 30 fps, use 1/60.\n6. Lighting:\nProper lighting is crucial for high-quality YouTube videos. Here are some lighting tips:\n\na. Use a three-point lighting setup: Key light (main light source), fill light (softens shadows), and backlight (separates subject from the background).\nb. Soften your light sources using softboxes or diffusion materials to reduce harsh shadows.\nc. Position your lights at 45-degree angles to the subject for even and flattering lighting.\nd. Consider using LED lights, as they offer adjustable color temperature and are energy-efficient.\n7. Monitor and Expose Correctly:\nUse the camera's built-in tools, such as false color, histogram, and zebras, to ensure proper exposure. Invest in an external monitor for more accurate preview and focus control.\n\nRemember, these are general guidelines, and the best settings may vary depending on your specific shooting conditions and creative preferences. Experiment with different settings and lighting setups to find what works best for your content.",

In general, the typical required purity of hydrogen for fuel cell applications is 99.99%, or \"four nines\" purity.\n\nThis high purity level is necessary to prevent impurities such as carbon monoxide, sulfur compounds, and particulates from entering the fuel cell and causing performance issues or damage to the fuel cell components. Even trace amounts of these impurities can have a significant impact on fuel cell performance and longevity.\n\nTo ensure the required purity level, the hydrogen used in fuel cell applications typically undergoes several stages of purification, such as PSA or membrane-based purification systems, to remove impurities from the hydrogen gas stream. In addition, the hydrogen storage and delivery systems must also be designed and constructed to maintain the required purity levels throughout the entire storage and delivery process.\n\nIt is worth noting that some types of fuel cells, such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), can tolerate higher levels of impurities in the hydrogen gas stream.

      "prompt": "I would like to make a website for my kid. The website will include things like a simple music player and photos/videos embedded into the site. I'd like to build this project in next js with typescript. I'd also like to dockerize it. And there should be some GQL layer, but I'm not sure how that will be set up or used for. Can we please iterate on this idea? I'd like you to send me a project outline as a numbered list of things I'll need to do in order. Add some details and please start at the very beginning, including any initial project setup, etc.",
      "response": "Sure, I can provide you with a project outline for your website. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:\n\n1. **Choose a domain name and web hosting provider:** Before you can start building your website, you'll need to choose a domain name and a web hosting provider. There are many options available, including Bluehost, GoDaddy, and HostGator. Once you've chosen a provider, you can purchase a domain name and set up your hosting account.\n2. **Create a Next.js project:** Next.js is a popular React-based framework for building web applications. To create a new Next.js project, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can create a new Next.js project by running the following command in your terminal:\n```lua\nnpx create-next-app my-app --typescript\n```\nThis will create a new Next.js project with TypeScript support.\n\n3. **Install necessary dependencies:** Once you have created your Next.js project, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. Some of the dependencies you will need for your project include:\n* graphql\n* apollo-client\n* apollo-server-micro\n* graphql-tag\n* next-apollo\n* next-images\n* react-player\n\nYou can install these dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:\n```python\nnpm install graphql apollo-client apollo-server-micro graphql-tag next-apollo next-images react-player\n```\n4. **Create a Dockerfile:** Docker is a platform that allows you to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. To dockerize your Next.js project, you'll need to create a Dockerfile. Here's an example of what your Dockerfile might look like:\n```Dockerfile\nFROM node:14-alpine\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY package*.json ./\n\nRUN npm install\n\nCOPY . .\n\nRUN npm run build\n\nEXPOSE 3000\n\nCMD [\"npm\", \"start\"]\n```\nThis Dockerfile will create a container that runs your Next.js application.\n\n5. **Create a GraphQL API:** To create a GraphQL API, you'll need to define your schema and resolvers. You can use a tool like Apollo Server to create your API. Here's an example of what your API might look like:\n```typescript\nimport { ApolloServer, gql } from 'apollo-server-micro';\n\nconst typeDefs = gql`\n  type Query {\n    songs: [Song]\n  }\n\n  type Song {\n    id: ID!\n    title: String!\n    artist: String!\n    url: String!\n  }\n`;\n\nconst songs = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    title: 'Song 1',\n    artist: 'Artist 1',\n    url: 'https://example.com/song1.mp3',\n  },\n  {\n    id: '2',\n    title: 'Song 2',\n    artist: 'Artist 2',\n    url: 'https://example.com/song2.mp3',\n  },\n];\n\nconst resolvers = {\n  Query: {\n    songs: () => songs,\n  },\n};\n\nconst server = new ApolloServer({\n  typeDefs,\n  resolvers,\n});\n\nexport default server.createHandler({ path: '/api/graphql' });\n```\nThis API will expose a `songs` query that returns an array of songs.\n\n6. **Integrate Apollo Client:** To consume your GraphQL API from your Next.js application, you'll need to integrate Apollo Client. Here's an example of what your `pages/_app.tsx` file might look like:\n```typescript\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app';\nimport { ApolloClient, ApolloProvider, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';\nimport { withApollo } from 'next-apollo';\n\nconst client = new\n```",

      "response": "One example of a scientific idea that was initially right, then believed to be wrong, and later proved to be right is the idea of continental drift. The theory was initially proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century but was met with skepticism by the scientific community at the time. It was not until the 1950s and 1960s, with the discovery of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics, that continental drift became widely accepted as a scientific fact.\n\nAnother example is the idea of heliocentrism, which states that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. This theory was first proposed by the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BCE but was not widely accepted until the 16th century. For a long time, the geocentric model, which placed the Earth at the center of the universe, was the dominant view in astronomy. However, with the development of telescopes and the work of scientists such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler, heliocentrism eventually became widely accepted as the correct model of the solar system.\n\nFinally, the idea of germ theory, which states that many diseases are caused by microorganisms, was initially proposed by scientists such as Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch in the 19th century. However, at the time, many people believed that diseases were caused by \"bad air\" or other non-microbial factors. It was not until the 20th century, with the development of antibiotics and other treatments for bacterial infections, that germ theory became widely accepted as a fundamental principle of medicine.",

      "response": "A probabilistic autoencoder is a type of neural network that is trained to reconstruct data by learning an efficient representation, or encoding, of the input data. It is called a \"probabilistic\" autoencoder because it is trained using a probabilistic approach, in which the network is trained to maximize the likelihood of the input data given the reconstructed data.\n\nProbabilistic autoencoders are often used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, denoising, and generating new data samples that are similar to a given dataset. They consist of two main components: an encoder network and a decoder network. The encoder network takes the input data and maps it to a lower-dimensional latent space, or encoding, while the decoder network maps the latent space back to the original data space. During training, the network is trained to minimize the reconstruction error between the input data and the reconstructed data, which encourages the network to learn an efficient and meaningful representation of the input data.\n\nOne advantage of probabilistic autoencoders is that they can be trained using an unsupervised learning approach, which means that they do not require labeled training data. This makes them useful for tasks where labeled data is scarce or difficult to obtain. Additionally, probabilistic autoencoders can be combined with other techniques, such as variational inference, to allow for more flexible and powerful modeling of complex data distributions.",

We analyze and report both experiments\ntogether.\nParticipants. Sixty-six undergraduate students (33 in each of\nExperiment 1a and Experiment 1b) from the University of Guelph\nbetween the ages of 17 and 27 years (M 18.40) participated for\npartial course credit. All participants reported having normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision and no color blindness.\nStimuli and apparatus. The stimuli and apparatus were identical in Experiments 1a and 1b aside from noted exceptions.\nParticipants reported the colors of memory items using a 360\u00b0\ncolor wheel. The color wheel used in all reported experiments was\ncreated based on the CIELAB color space with the intention that\ncolors would differ only in hue and not in luminance, and the\nperceptual difference between two adjacent colors anywhere on\nthe wheel would be comparable. In Experiment 1a, this color\nwheel was not calibrated to the specific monitors used; however,\nthis limitation was remedied in Experiments 1b and 2, in which\nexperimental monitors were assessed using a colorimeter (Konica\nMinolta CS-100A; Konica Minolta Sensing Americas, Inc., Ramsey, New Jersey) and the color wheel was adjusted for each\nmonitor. The colors of memory items on each trial were randomly\nselected from the color wheel with the constraint that all colors\nwere separated by a minimum of 40\u00b0 on the wheel. All stimuli\nwere viewed on a 1,280 1,024 cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor\nusing a 75-Hz refresh rate with a gray background, and viewing\ndistance was fixed at 57 cm using a head and chin rest.\nProcedure. On each trial participants were shown a memory\narray for 300 msec (see Figure 1). The memory array in Experiment 1a comprised two squares and two circles (each 1.2\u00b0 in width\nand height) placed randomly in four of eight possible positions\nspaced equally around an invisible circle with a 5.5\u00b0 diameter that\nwas centered on a central fixation point with a 0.07\u00b0 radius. The\nmemory array in Experiment 1b comprised three squares and three\ncircles, and we increased the eccentricity of stimuli to 8\u00b0 to reduce\ncrowding. After a 900-msec delay, a probe screen was displayed,\nwhich presented the black outline of all four shapes in their\noriginal spatial locations surrounded by the color wheel, the outer\nedge of which was 12\u00b0 from fixation. Participants were asked to\nreport the color of a probed (outlined in a thick black line) shape\nas it had appeared in the preceding memory array by clicking the\ncorresponding color on the color wheel. The orientation of the\ncolor wheel was randomized on each trial. This probe screen\nremained visible until participants made a response and was followed by a 500-msec intertrial interval.\nParticipants were instructed that for the duration of the experiment, memory items that were one shape (i.e., either squares or\ncircles) were more likely to be probed than the other; shape was\npseudo-counterbalanced across participants. Participants completed four blocks of 150 trials, and the likelihood that a highprobability shape would be probed was manipulated across blocks\nto be 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%. Participants were informed of this\nprobability at the outset of each block, and the order of the blocks\nwas randomized for each participant. Of note, this procedure\nresults in a large number of trials in which a high-probability\nshape is probed and only a small number of trials in which the\nlow-probability shape is probed, especially for the 90% block.\nFor Experiments 1a and 1b, we were primarily interested in how\nthe probability manipulation affected memory for highprobability items; thus, our analyses focus on only trials in\nwhich a high-probability item was probed, resulting in a fully\ncrossed, mixed design with one within-subjects factor (ProbaFigure 1.

In all reported experiments, we assess VWM performance using several measures all based on raw response error\n(i.e., the angular degree of distance between the color of the probed\nitem and the participant\u2019s response). We first calculated the variability of responses for each probability condition by taking the\nstandard deviation of participants\u2019 response errors (SDresponse).\nHere, lower values reflect responses distributed more closely\naround the target color, which we interpret as generally reflecting\nmore precise representations in VWM.\nUsing a three-parameter mixture model (Bays et al., 2009), we\nfurther broke raw response errors down into three separate components that each reflect different aspects of VWM performance.\nThis model asserts that three different distributions contribute to\nthe likelihood of a given response: a uniform distribution reflecting\nthe proportion of random guesses; a von Mises distribution reflecting the proportion of responses centered around the actual color of\nthe probed item, the standard deviation of which is inversely\nrelated to VWM fidelity; and the proportion of reports that are\ncentered around nonprobed items (i.e., \u201cswap\u201d reports of nontargets, likely a consequence of a spatial binding error). To account\nfor these nontarget errors, Bays and colleagues developed this\nthree-parameter mixture model from the standard two-parameter\nmixture model proposed by Zhang and Luck (2008a), which included only a uniform distribution and a von Mises distribution.\nFor the precise mathematical definition of this model, see Equation\n2 in Bays et al. (2009). We used maximum likelihood estimation\n(MLE) to decompose raw errors into these three parameters via\nMATLAB and the MemToolBox library (Suchow, Brady, Fougnie, & Alvarez, 2013).\nIt has been argued that some variability in memory performance\nis a consequence of random fluctuations in memory fidelity across\nitems within a trial, and this source of variance is captured in a\nclass of models termed variable precision models (Fougnie,\nSuchow, & Alvarez, 2012; van den Berg, Shin, Chou, George, &\nMa, 2012). To assess whether any observed effects of our probability manipulation are influenced by also accounting for random\nfluctuations in fidelity, we modeled SDresponse using a variable\nprecision model that has been previously shown to provide a good\naccount of memory performance\u2014the VP-A-NT model reported\nby van den Berg et al. (2014). This model assumes that memory is\na continuous resource distributed across all memory items and, as\nsuch, it does not include a parameter reflecting random guesses.\nHowever, this model does estimate how an item\u2019s precision (J\n\n)\nchanges as a power-law function (\u0004) of the number of memorized\nitems. Furthermore, along with the contribution of random fluctuations in memory fidelity, this model estimates how the likelihood\nof making nontarget errors changes with set size (NTslope). Model\nfitting was accomplished via MATLAB and a collection of functions provided by van den Berg et al. (2014). Of note, the code was\nadjusted to allow for our probability manipulation to replace the\ntraditional set size manipulation; to accomplish this we input \u201cset\nsize\u201d as the inverse of probability (Emrich et al., in press). Our\nprimary interest was whether this variable precision model would\nreveal comparable effects of our probability manipulation on precision (\u0004) and nontarget errors (NTslope) to those revealed by the\nthree-parameter mixture model.",

      "prompt": "Here Damian! This is another example of my technical writing, please analyze the style, science, and rhetoric that I used. Really get to know my writing style with this one:\n\n\"\nThe piezoelectric effect is the ability of materials to generate electricity in response to mechanical stress. Likewise, piezoelectric materials can receive electricity and convert it into mechanical stress. It has many applications, such as power sources, sensors, and motors. \n There have been many studies in vitro that show the potential that piezoelectric nFNIs could potentially be stable. Boron nitride nanotubes were used to stimulate PC-12, C2C12 cells, and SH-SY5Y cells to see if neurite growth would be expedited with electrical stimulation, which was found to be true[7.]. In another study, barium titanate was electrostatically attached to SH-SY5Y and induced calcium influxes when stimulated by ultrasound. Both of the nanoparticles were dispersed into the media, and they were rapidly internalized by the cells. As stated previously for quantum dots, the internalization of nFNIs is highly non-ideal due to the impossibility of retrieval. Likewise, the amount of energy produced by the vibrating nano piezo crystals is still unknown, meaning it may not be powerful enough to generate an action potential. \n Another relatively unknown aspect is the biocompatibility of the different piezocrystals. Boron nitride has been shown in vitro to not exhibit any toxicity in human kidney cells [29.], and barium titanate showed minimal toxicity in mouse osteoblasts 7F2 cells as it caused a nonsignificant inflammatory response[30.]. \nDesigning a theoretical system\n In this section of the paper, a theoretical brain-computer interface will be designed based on the current state of nFNIs. Ideally, the system would be capable of targeting a specific region of the brain in a safe, practical manner that would allow for high-resolution, bidirectional communication. The system would be designed for humans. Therefore, it would need to be made from materials approved for human use or have been proven to show no toxicity to human cells. Ideally, this system\u2019s operation would not cause a significant temperature increase. The mean temperature of the brain is 38.4\u00b0C[31.], and at 40\u00b0C heatstrokes can occur[32.]. Therefore, the temperature should not be raised by 1\u00b0C to ensure patient safety. Lastly, the long-term viability of the neural interfaces used will be used to establish whether or not the system would be viable for long-term placement, and methods of complete retrieval will be investigated. \n The three types of signals viable for deep stimulation of human neurons are light, magnetic fields, and ultrasound. There seems to exist a tradeoff between spatial resolution and penetration depth. NIR light has a relatively low penetration depth of 4.4mm, but a spatial resolution of 0.05mm. Conversely, magnetic fields have a relatively good penetration depth of 5 cm. Still, they also have a low spatial resolution of 1 cm. Lastly, microwaves have a penetration depth of 5cm and a spatial resolution of 4mm. However, nFNIs being bound directly to target neurons will allow for precise stimulation regardless of spatial resolution. \n\nA fundamental problem with the three types of stimulation is that the signal depth is not deep enough to stimulate the brain\u2019s deepest recesses from the surface. The average human brain has dimensions of 167mmx140mmx93mm[33.].\n \nEquation 1: Volume of an Ellipsoid where a equals the horizontal semi-axis(length), b equals the vertical semi-axis(height), and c equals the original axis (depth)\nUnder the assumption that the average brain\u2019s area can be represented by an ellipsoid, the area affected by the primary signals can be calculated. Using the equation, the average volume of the human brain is approximately 1138 cm3. \nPrimary Energy Type\nThe volume of the brain affected in cm3\nPercentage of the Brain affected\nNIR\n223\n20.0%\nUltrasound\n641\n56.3%\nMagnetic\n901\n79.2%\nMicrowave\n901\n79.2%\n\nTable 4: Calculation of the Percentage of the brain affected by the different primary signals.\n\nIn the above table, the maximum penetration depth was utilized to approximate how much of the brain each primary signal could affect. Using equation 1, the penetration depth was subtracted from the radius of each dimension resulting in an ellipsoid of reduced size. The resulting ellipsoid represented the area unaffected by the signal, so each smaller ellipsoid was subtracted from the average volume of the human brain, 1138 cm3 to obtain the area affected by the signal. For the system to be a suitable advancement in the functional neural interfaces, nFNIs would need to be capable of modulation at any depth. Therefore, a system would need to account for the relatively low signal depth and unique properties of nFNIs. \nMany inventions are biomimetic in nature. To solve the dilemma of insufficient signal depth, I propose looking to neurons to provide an answer. Neurons can carry electrical signals across the body despite their relatively low power by using axons that are activated once the neuron is activated. Similarly, when stimulated, nFNIs could produce a secondary signal in their local area, potentially activating ion channels. However, instead of activating ion channels, the nFNIs could activate other nFNIs that can propagate the signal deeper into the brain. These long chains could essentially act as self-constructing nanowires that travel directly to the target neuron. These nanowires could work in networks or independently, but they could allow for deep ultrasonic, magnetic, or even optical stimulation. Likewise, recording nanowires could propagate signals received from neurons to relay activity to the surface of the brain, where they can be readily recorded. Ideally, the recording nanowires would be different nFNIs than the stimulating nFNIs to avoid noise or false positive signals. Likewise, the relay nFNIs would also be distinct from the stimulating nFNIs to avoid unintentional stimulation of nontargeted neurons while propagating the signal. \n\nFigure 4: The above figure depicts the proposed method for using scaffolding proteins to make nanowires. Each scaffolding protein would have three magnetic nanoparticles (one on the top, middle, and bottom). The magnetic nanoparticles would propagate the magnetic signal until it reached the magnetoelectric nanotransducer (figure on the left). The figure on the right depicts a similar system. However, the last scaffolding protein has a MMN attached to the end, which would be used to stimulate the piezoelectric crystal.\n Of the four nFNIs previously described, only three will be considered for the system. MMNs, MENS, and piezocrystals all exhibited minimal to no cytotoxicity, but QDs have shown to be highly toxic if the coating dissolves. While it may have interesting properties, it should not be used in humans for a practical system. Therefore with the restriction that the system would require different nFNIs for stimulation, relay, and recording, MMNs, MENs, and piezocrystals will be evaluated for their ability for each role. \nPiezocrystals and MENs would most likely serve as the best stimulating nFNI. Piezocrystals could be a good option due to the universality of electricity in modulating/activating neurons. MMNs would not be as good of a candidate because mechanosensitive ion channels are not as prevalent as voltage-gated ion channels. Electricity offers a reliable method of altering excitability throughout various neurons. For MENs to be a stimulating nFNI, a nanowire composed of magnetic nanoparticles would need to be used as the relay signal to propagate the signal to the neuron. For piezocrystals to be an ideal stimulating nFNI, MMNs could be used as the relay nFNI because they could mechanically stress the piezocrystal resulting in an electric charge. However, for the attached MMN to receive the signal, a nanowire made of nanomagnets would also need to be attached to the MMN. Experimentation would need to be conducted to determine which method would be superior as both show potential for the modulation of neurons.\nFor the recording nFNI, neuronal electrical activity will need to be detected and propagated to the brain\u2019s surface for simplified measurement. Therefore, piezo crystals or MENs would be the best candidates. Ideally, the recording nanowires would differ in signal propagation methods than the stimulating nanowires, but it does not mean the system would be incapable of functioning as intended. The problem can be solved by ensuring the nanowire has some form of insulation to hinder the spread of the signal. The insulation can be in the form of a substrate or binding protein, as discussed later. MENs will most likely prove to be the most efficient recording nFNI. It can convert the received electrical input from the neuron directly into a magnetic field that can be propagated through the wire. Near the brain\u2019s surface, the tail-end of the wire would be topped with a corresponding MEN to convert the signal to electricity for measurement. \nWhile most of the current studies involving nFNIs occurring in vitro show stable neural interfaces, the neural interfaces may not necessarily be stable in vivo. With this in mind, the nanowire would need to be anchored to the ion channels of the target neuron and the skull for efficient signal propagation. Having the nFNIs bound to a protein would reduce the likelihood of internalization of the individual particle. Likewise, if the particles are in the form of nanowires, it would significantly reduce the chance of internalization. Ideally, the protein would be a durable, biocompatible material capable of binding to the respective nFNI, isolating the signal produced by the nFNI, and binding to other proteins to form the nanowires. Due to the specificity of the requirements needed for such a protein, there has not been any evidence in the literature of such a protein. Scaffolding proteins show an interesting starting point for investigation. Scaffolding proteins typically help to relay messages between the cell membrane and the nucleus[34.]. If a scaffolding protein could be designed to hold the magnetic nanoparticles as shown in figure 4, it would allow for testing of the proposed nano interface. \nFuture Perspectives\n Nano functional neural interfaces is a rapidly developing field with many vital insights being found daily. In this paper, QDs, MENs, MMNs, and piezocrystals were investigated for their biocompatibility, feasibility, and potential for use in a theoretical brain-computer interface. nFNIs show great potential in overcoming the insensibility and indistinguishability problems currently held by the field as a whole. However, nFNIs are still limited by the penetration depth and spatial resolution of the stimulating signals. For the field to progress, noninvasive stimulation methods would need to advance, allowing for higher spatial resolution and greater depth. In this paper, a potential solution was proposed to the problem in the form of protein chains containing nFNIs to relay the signal bidirectionally. The proposed solution would require the discovery of a protein capable of handling the design requirements needed to bind to the nFNIs, insulate the signal, and form durable chains that will need to be investigated further. If these advancements are made, the proposed solution could potentially help to push the understanding of the brain to new levels.\n\"",

      "response": "Yes, it is possible to convert a .txt or .asc file into API format, but it depends on the content and structure of the file.\n\nAPI files typically have a specific structure and format that is designed to allow software components to communicate with each other. The specific format and structure may vary depending on the requirements of the API and the programming language being used to implement it.\n\nIf the .txt or .asc file contains data that is structured in a way that is compatible with the desired API format, then it may be possible to convert the file into API format by writing a script or program to parse the data and generate the necessary API files.\n\nHowever, if the .txt or .asc file contains unstructured or poorly structured data, then it may be more difficult or impossible to convert it into API format without significant data cleaning or restructuring.\n\nIn general, the process of converting a file into API format will depend on the specific requirements of the API and the format and structure of the original file.",

Convert 13:30 IST to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)\nIST is Indian Standard Time, which is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC. So,\n\n13:30 IST = 08:00 UTC\n\n2. Determine the difference in time between the standard meridian (82\u00b030\u2019 E) and the local meridian of Delhi (77\u00b012\u2019 E)\n\nThe standard meridian for India is 82\u00b030\u2019 E. Delhi is located at 77\u00b012\u2019 E. The time difference between these two longitudes can be calculated as follows:\n\nTime difference = (local time meridian - standard time meridian) x 4 minutes\n= (77\u00b012\u2019 E - 82\u00b030\u2019 E) x 4 minutes\n= -21.2 minutes\n\u2248 -21 minutes (rounded to the nearest minute)\n\nThis means that local time in Delhi is about 21 minutes behind the standard time for India.\n\n3. Apply the equation of time correction\n\nThe equation of time correction on July 1 is -4 minutes. This means that the apparent solar time is 4 minutes behind the mean solar time on this day.\n\n4. Calculate the local apparent time\n\nTo calculate the local apparent time, we need to add the time difference and the equation of time correction to the UTC time.\n\nLocal Apparent Time = UTC + time difference + equation of time correction\n= 08:00 + (-21) + (-4)\n= 07:35 UTC\n\n5. Convert the local apparent time to IST\n\nDelhi is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC, so we need to add this offset to the local apparent time to get the local apparent time in IST.\n\nLocal Apparent Time in IST = Local Apparent Time + 5:30\n= 07:35 + 5:30\n= 13:05\n\nTherefore, the local apparent time corresponding to 13:30 IST on July 1, at Delhi (28\u00b035\u2019 N,77\u00b012\u2019 E) is 13:05 IST.",

      "prompt": "Below is the text of a news article. Please write a 5-sentence summary, focused on the factual content and removing any sensationalism or anxiety-inducing content:\n\nIt is the latest stunning barrier shattered by the nation\u2019s most unruly president. And it means that after a tumultuous four-year term, a historic two impeachments, an election falsely tainted by Trump\u2019s lies about fraud and a mob attack by his supporters on Congress, a new national nightmare may be ahead.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 22: U.S. President Donald Trump exits the Oval Office and walks to Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on September 22, 2020 in Washington, DC. President Trump is traveling to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for a campaign event. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nTrump has been indicted. Here's what happens next in court\nIn a momentous step Thursday, a Manhattan grand jury voted to indict Trump on what sources said were more than 30 counts related to business fraud in a case arising from hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels, possibly to defuse a scandal ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nThere is nothing in American history that approaches the tumult of the charging and possible trial and conviction of a former president \u2013 especially since Trump and his supporters are already claiming that the indictment represents the weaponized politicization of the justice system.\n\n\u201cWe have been close before (but) we have never been at this point,\u201d John Dean, former President Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate-era special counsel, told CNN. \u201cNo prior president \u2013 former, sitting or otherwise \u2013 has ever been indicted.\u201d\n\nGiven the extreme national political estrangement exacerbated by Trump, this case is likely to leave the country changed however it turns out. There will be fears, for instance, that it will crush one of the last remaining precedents for political restraint and leave future presidents vulnerable to prosecution in a manner more akin to fragile failing states than the world\u2019s most vital democracy. Yet at the same time, if Trump has indeed committed crimes, a failure to pursue him would send a message that the powerful can get away with behavior that ordinary Americans cannot.\n\nThe move was especially stunning given Trump\u2019s long record of impunity, which has seen him constantly stretch the limits of the law and the conventions of accepted behavior with his uproarious personal, business and political careers. Suddenly, Trump\u2019s decades of evading accountability will end. The former president will have to start answering for his conduct, likely beginning in court on Tuesday after he travels to New York to be arraigned in what will be a high-security spectacle given his past incitement of violence.\n\nTrump launches a furious counter-attack\nTrump insists he is innocent of all allegations, in this case as well as in several others that may pose even greater legal peril, including special counsel investigations into his hoarding of classified documents and his conduct around the 2020 election and a separate Georgia investigation into his bid to steal the election in the swing state.\n\nThe ex-president quickly showed he\u2019s ready to drive the country into a deep political crisis as he mounts his defense with wild claims of persecution. He accused Democrats of weaponizing justice to thwart his 2024 White House bid \u2013 a claim that threatens to shatter the credibility of the next election in the eyes of millions of his followers and further damage US democracy.\n\n\u201cThis is an attack on our country the likes of which has never been seen before,\u201d Trump wrote in block capitals on his Truth Social network. \u201cIt is likewise a continuing attack on our once free and fair elections. The USA is now a third world nation, a nation in serious decline. So sad!\u201d\n\nLike all Americans accused of crimes, Trump is entitled to the presumption of innocence and his full rights under the Constitution, which he tried to overturn on January, 6, 2021. The perception of this extraordinary case will turn on two questions fundamental to the credibility of American justice: Are all citizens \u2013 even the most powerful, like former presidents and White House candidates \u2013 considered equal under the law? Or is Trump being singled out because of who he is?\n\nThe indictment voted by the grand jury remains under seal, so the exact charges and the extent of evidence against him remain unclear. But many legal experts have questioned whether a case possibly alleging fraudulent accounting and subsequent infringements of election law would rise to the magnitude that might justify the nation-shaking act of indicting a former president and frontrunner for the 2024 GOP nomination. Some observers have warned against a case that might rely heavily on the testimony of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who made the payments to Daniels and has already served a jail sentence for charges that included lying to Congress.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy speaks during a Friends of Ireland caucus St. Patrick's Day luncheon at the Capitol in Washington on Friday, March 17.\nRepublican leaders and Trump loyalists on Capitol Hill rally behind the former president after indictment\nEven if there is plentiful evidence that makes this a relatively simple sell to a jury, the fame and the power of the defendant means the case will unfold in a court of public opinion. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is under enormous pressure since if he fails to secure a conviction, he will be accused even more than he already is of building a politicized case that could tear gaping new divides in the country.\n\nTrump\u2019s most fervent supporters in the House of Representatives lambasted Bragg despite having not seen the charges or evidence against the former president. The angry reactions were consistent with Trump\u2019s previous attempts to intimidate Bragg, which were set off nearly two weeks ago with his inaccurate prediction that he\u2019d be arrested early last week. The strategy was clearly designed to prejudice public opinion against the case before Trump even appears in court and to energize the former president\u2019s grassroots supporters and the conservative media machine.\n\n\u201cOutrageous\u201d was the only comment issued by House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of the ex-president\u2019s most staunch loyalists.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy tweeted, \u201cThe American people will not tolerate this injustice,\u201d and added that \u201cThe House of Representatives will hold Alvin Bragg and his unprecedented abuse of power to account\u201d \u2013 a comment that appeared to indicate a fresh attempt to use government power to interfere in an active case going through America\u2019s independent legal system.\n\nThe No. 2 House Republican \u2013 Majority Leader Steve Scalise \u2013 called the indictment \u201cone of the clearest examples of extremist Democrats weaponizing government to attack their political opponents.\u201d Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair, released a statement saying the indictment was \u201ca political witch hunt\u201d and a \u201cdark day for America.\u201d There was no immediate comment, however, from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, underscoring the divides in the GOP over Trump\u2019s past assault on American democracy and political aspirations.\n\nIndictment shakes up 2024 White House race\nIt is too early to predict how voters, in the GOP primary or in the national electorate, will respond to Trump\u2019s indictment. And it is also unclear whether a possible trial would take place before the 2024 election or where the multiple other investigations into Trump\u2019s conduct will be by then.\n\nBut Thursday\u2019s historic news out of Manhattan immediately scrambled the GOP nominating contest.\n\nThe move forced the ex-president\u2019s potential Republican rivals into hurried condemnations to preserve their own viability among GOP voters.\n\n\u201cI think the unprecedented indictment of a former president of the United States on a campaign finance issue is an outrage,\u201d former Vice President Mike Pence told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer in an interview. \u201cIt appears to millions of Americans to be nothing more than a political prosecution that\u2019s driven by a prosecutor who literally ran for office on a pledge to indict the former president.\u201d\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at Christopher Columbus High School on Monday, March 27, 2023, in Miami. \nPotential 2024 GOP field responds to Trump indictment by attacking Bragg\nTrump blames Pence for failing to intervene in Congress\u2019 certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory \u2013 a position that may limit the former vice president\u2019s political ceiling in a party still filled with Trump loyalists.\n\nAny immediate political boost Trump is able to engineer from the indictment could harm his potential strongest primary rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Like other potential candidates, DeSantis had no political room to do anything other than condemn the indictment \u2013 even though he has been portraying himself as a potential president who would be far more calm, methodical and effective in implementing a hardline conservative agenda than Trump was.\n\nBut DeSantis also made an extraordinary threat that if Trump were to resist turning himself in, he would refuse to participate in any attempt by New York to extradite him \u2013 a move that, if it happened, could precipitate a constitutional crisis.\n\n\u201cThe weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head. It is un-American,\u201d DeSantis tweeted. \u201cFlorida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances at issue with this Soros-backed Manhattan prosecutor and his political agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Florida governor\u2019s threat was just one ill omen that suggests the months ahead will be divisive and dangerous to America\u2019s democracy \u2013 whether Trump is found guilty or not.",

      "response": "It is difficult to give a general optimization advice on a MySQL configuration file without knowing the specific usage and workload of the database server. However, there are a few suggestions that might improve the performance of the database server:\n\n* Increase the value of the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` to match the amount of available memory, if possible. This parameter controls the size of the InnoDB buffer pool, which stores data and indexes for InnoDB tables. Having a large buffer pool can help reduce disk I/O.\n* Increase the `innodb_log_file_size` to improve write performance, since a larger log file size allows for more data to be written to the log file before it is flushed to disk.\n* You might also want to consider turning off the query cache by setting the `query_cache_type` to 0, because it might not provide any performance boost, or worse, it might even cause performance degradation if your workload is primarily write-heavy.\n* Be sure to have at least 1G RAM for every concurrently running connection. A too high max\\_connections variable will make server run out of resources and crash.\n* Monitor your server to get more specific metrics and adjust your configuration accordingly.\n\nPlease also be aware that these modifications might have a major impact on performance and might have a severe impact if not done correctly, it is recommended to test any changes on a non-production environment first.\n\nIt is worth noting that the configuration you posted seems to be default MySQL configuration file, this by no means is ideal configuration, it is tailored to a specific use case, you should consider and consult MySQL's documentation, as well as other sources that provide sample configuration that are better suited to your workload.",

      "prompt": "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n Trigger Points: Muscle Pain and Back Pain\n From Chris and Jeremy\nMost of us\u2014the newcomers anyway\u2014tend to think of back pain as something that is largely in the spine itself. The bones, discs, ligaments, and nerves. But what most of us don\u2019t focus on are the surrounding and supporting muscles. Which is a mistake, because they can be a major source of back pain (or something that can pass as back pain). And getting \u201cright\u201d with those muscles can be mighty important. \nTo be accurate, back pain is almost always a not-so-pleasing blend of muscle pain, joint pain, nerve pain, and other pain. This can be a little confusing. All pain is transmitted by nerves. When we speak of muscle pain or nerve pain, we are referring to the primary source of pain\u2014that is, the pain-generating tissue. Sometimes an aggravated nerve is the source of pain so it is referred to as nerve pain. In this chapter, we are talking about pain whose primary source is muscles. Even though the pain is transmitted to your brain via nerves, the tissue that\u2019s causing the pain is muscle tissue, so we refer to it as muscle pain. It is helpful to think of that which is primarily muscle pain differently, because it manifests itself differently, and Jeremy\u2019s approach to it is different, too.\nThere\u2019s good news and bad news here (wouldn\u2019t you know it). The bad news is that muscle pain is harder to locate and trickier to fix in the first instance. The good news is that it is actually easier to fix in the long run, and your prospects of a complete cure are much better. \nWhich is not to say it does not hurt like blazes. Up in the 8\u201310 range, on a scale of 10. But often the relief can be sudden and nearly complete. You still have to do serious stuff to keep it from coming back once the fix is made, but that\u2019s always true. \nMuscle Pain\nPeople in the healing professions refer to muscle pain both as \u201cmyofascial pain\u201d and \u201ctrigger point pain.\u201d For laymen like you and me, \u201ctrigger point pain\u201d may be the more useful name, because it feels like that\u2014something that gets \u201ctriggered\u201d by some silly move you made. Whatever we call it, trigger point pain has been a somewhat controversial topic for decades, mostly because no medical discipline claims ownership of the muscular system. Doctors are far more concerned with the joints, bursae, ligaments, and nerves. There has not been as much study of the muscular system and trigger point pain. But there has been enough, so that there is broad agreement on many points. And the best practitioners, and Jeremy in particular, have seen a lot of it. \nSo, what is it? Here\u2019s Jeremy: \u201cTrigger points are tight, painful bands of muscle tissue that have predictable and recognizable patterns of pain.\u201d To put it another way, they are muscle spasms (not quite right but close enough), which is what you get when a muscle or muscle segment seizes up, under pressure, and won\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like those cramps you sometimes get in your leg, except it doesn\u2019t go away and the pain can be horrendous. Unbearable, some of the time. These spasms or cramps not only cause terrible pain in their own right, but they can change the way some joints function. As Jeremy puts it, \u201cThey also limit range of motion and change the normal distribution of loads on nearby joints, which can also cause pain.\u201d So trigger point pain is serious, and it has more than one way to grab you. If it has started to affect the range of motion of the nearby joint, in the way Jeremy suggests, clearing it up is harder, but the approach is the same. \nOne thing to bear in mind is that trigger points basically \u201clie\u201d to us. That is to say, the obvious pain may crop up away from the actual trigger point itself. For example, the trigger point may be in the gluteus minimus (that\u2019s a favorite spot, actually), but the pain may run down the leg, mimicking sciatica. Or a trigger point in the gluteus medius may read as pain in the lower back. There are a lot of variations, but the patterns are well known and predictable, so professionals know where to look for the originating problem. Most of the time, anyway. Pretty soon, you will, too. \nOne thing that helps is that trigger point or muscle pain in general is recognizably different from nerve pain (again, this means pain in which an aggravated nerve is the source of the pain, not just the means of transmission to your brain) and other pain, so that you know what you are dealing with. Most of the time, nerve pain, for example, is \u201cburning, sharp, electric,\u201d and you can pinpoint exactly where it is. Trigger point pain, on the other hand, is achy, diffuse, hard to localize, and dull. And it often arises far from the source, which is a trigger point in a muscle. \nOne reason it is called trigger point pain is that it is usually \u201ctriggered\u201d by an actual event, just the way it feels. You rolled over funny in bed, you opened the Sub-Zero too vigorously, you picked up the box of books with your back, not your legs. Sometimes, those triggering events are one-off incidents, which is the way they feel. But more often, the trigger point (or vulnerability) has been building for a long time. Vulnerable muscles or muscle segments have been under repetitious pressure for a long time, and they are ready to \u201cgo\u201d at the drop of a hat. You open the Sub-Zero funny and pow! A terrifying spasm. A latent trigger point like that can \u201cgo\u201d without any trigger event at all or with a trifling one. Let us hope that yours is a \u201cone-off,\u201d not one that has been building for years, because the one-off takes less time to heal. But never mind, the approach is just the same. \nThe most common trigger points are the ones that have been caused by muscular overload, and that have developed over time. Think of the familiar situation: You sit at your desk for months and years. It is an \u201cunnatural\u201d position, and it puts repetitive pressure on muscles that aren\u2019t built for it. Or it can be repetitively misplaced loads, caused by you doing some move the same wrong way, year after year, like a faulty golf swing. Say you sprain an ankle and you never quite rehab the ankle the way you should. Over the following weeks and months you walk slightly differently than you used to. This subtle change causes muscles in your legs and pelvis to bear loads in a different way. Some now bear more loads, some less. Over time, those muscles that are now bearing more loads get stressed and strained, and trigger points develop. The pain from these can come on gradually or suddenly. As we have said all along, most of the time, you have built your own back pain, over time, with the way you behave. That is true for most muscle pain, too. \nFinding Trigger Points\nOkay, on to the details. \n\u201cFor low back pain sufferers, the most important and common areas for trigger points to occur are in the lumbar paraspinals, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and piriformis.\u201d Sorry, that\u2019s Jeremy; he just can\u2019t help himself. But you don\u2019t have to memorize the names; you just have to look at the pictures to get the general idea. And then feel around for the real source of the pain. When I say look at the pictures, I mean look and see if you can relate what you feel to the typical patterns the pictures show. The Xs represent the location of the real trigger point and the red shaded areas represent the area where you may perceive the pain. So think about where you feel the pain. Then look at the pictures. Then go to work to find where the X may mark the spot. When you find it, it will hurt a lot more than the surrounding area. Bingo! Think of these pictures as \u201ctreasure maps\u201d and the treasure is eventual release from pain. \nThis process is very much \u201chands on.\u201d It can be challenging to distinguish areas of perceived pain from actual trigger points until you get a feel for what you are looking for. If you try multiple times and fail, you may need the assistance of a good chiropractor, massage therapist, or physical therapist to get the hang of this. To get started, grope around with your hands (using the pictures as a guide to the general area) until you have a fair idea of where the real trigger points are. You will know them because they hurt more. For once, the pain is the good news. It means that you\u2019re getting close. Or you\u2019re there. \nBy the way, the muscles where the trigger point lies can be deep. The gluteus minimus, for example, is buried beneath two other muscles and a layer of fat. Some of you are not going to have the strength or leverage to reach that trigger point with your hand alone. You may need to use a tennis ball or foam roller, which will be discussed in the following pages. But, to start, just use your hand until you get a general idea if there is something deep in those muscles that needs to be released. And don\u2019t forget: Use the pictures as your guide. \nOnce you have a general idea of where the trigger point is, mash away at it, if you like, with your bare hands, and see if that manual manipulation is enough to \u201crelease\u201d the rascal. What you do is hold down hard on the place that hurts the most and\u2014in ten to thirty seconds or so\u2014you should feel an easing of the pain. That is the trigger point letting go. Nice work. If the pain does not ease up after thirty seconds or so, either you are not directly",

      "response": "Edited Paragraph:\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) have demonstrated remarkable resilience and commitment despite the anxiety of contracting and transmitting the virus to others (Liu, Luo et al., 2020). Studies have shown that HCWs and their close contacts are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 (Shah, Wood et al., 2020). Specifically, research has compared the risk of COVID-19 hospital admission between HCWs, their family members, and the general population. Although the risk ratio was low, during the first quarter of the pandemic, patients who had contact with HCWs were three times more likely to be admitted with COVID-19 than those who did not come in contact with HCWs. Furthermore, the risk was multiplied among family members of front-facing HCWs, with various factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and comorbidity (Chou, Dana et al., 2020; Nguyen, Drew et al., 2020).\n\nCritique and Reasoning:\n\nThe original paragraph contains several errors in syntax, grammar, and style. The first sentence is convoluted and lacks clarity, making it difficult for the reader to understand the author's point. In addition, the use of abbreviations such as HCWs and COVID-19 without prior definition may confuse the reader. The second sentence contains a citation without proper integration into the text. The third sentence is unclear and does not convey the main finding of the study. The fourth sentence lacks coherence and includes a redundant phrase. Finally, the fifth sentence is too long and contains multiple pieces of information that should be separated into distinct statements.\n\nTo improve the quality of the paragraph, I made several changes. First, I simplified the language and syntax to improve readability and clarity. Second, I defined the abbreviations HCWs and COVID-19 to make the text more accessible to the reader. Third, I integrated the citations seamlessly into the text to support the author's claims. Fourth, I rephrased some of the sentences to convey the information more effectively. Finally, I split the final sentence into two shorter sentences to improve clarity and readability.",

      "response": "My apologies for the confusion. I misunderstood the problem earlier. The issue is that the `message` function of the `EdgeConv2DGCNConv` class is expecting both `x_j` and `edge_attr` to have the same shape. However, the current implementation generates edge features for each edge, which is not compatible with the convolutional layers.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to modify the `message` function to apply the convolution on `x_j` only, and then use a learnable weight matrix to transform the `edge_attr` before combining it with `x_j`. Here's the revised `EdgeConv2DGCNConv` class:\n```python\nclass EdgeConv2DGCNConv(MessagePassing):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):\n        super(EdgeConv2DGCNConv, self).__init__(aggr='add')\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)\n        self.edge_attr_transform = nn.Linear(in_channels, out_channels)\n\n    def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_attr):\n        return self.propagate(edge_index, x=x, edge_attr=edge_attr)\n\n    def message(self, x_j, edge_attr):\n        x_j = self.conv(x_j)\n        edge_attr = self.edge_attr_transform(edge_attr)\n        return x_j + edge_attr.unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1)\n```\nHere's the complete revised script:\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch_geometric.nn as pyg_nn\nimport torch_geometric.data as pyg_data\nfrom torch_geometric.nn import MessagePassing\nfrom torch_geometric.utils import erdos_renyi_graph\n\nclass EdgeConv2DGCNConv(MessagePassing):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):\n        super(EdgeConv2DGCNConv, self).__init__(aggr='add')\n        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)\n        self.edge_attr_transform = nn.Linear(in_channels, out_channels)\n\n    def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_attr):\n        return self.propagate(edge_index, x=x, edge_attr=edge_attr)\n\n    def message(self, x_j, edge_attr):\n        x_j = self.conv(x_j)\n        edge_attr = self.edge_attr_transform(edge_attr)\n        return x_j + edge_attr.unsqueeze(-1).unsqueeze(-1)\n\nclass GNNClassifier(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, num_classes):\n        super(GNNClassifier, self).__init__()\n        self.gnn = EdgeConv2DGCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)\n        self.pool = pyg_nn.global_mean_pool\n        self.classifier = nn.Linear(hidden_channels, num_classes)\n\n    def forward(self, data):\n        x, edge_index, edge_attr = data.x, data.edge_index, data.edge_attr\n        print(x.shape, edge_index.shape, edge_attr.shape)\n        x = self.gnn(x, edge_index, edge_attr)\n        x = torch.relu(x)\n        x = x.mean(dim=(2, 3))  # Global average pooling for image-like features\n        x = self.pool(x, data.batch)\n        out = self.classifier(x)\n        return out\n\nnum_nodes = 10\nin_channels = 16\nhidden_channels = 32\nnum_classes = 3\nbatch_size = 2\n\n# Create a random graph with a valid edge_index tensor\np = 0.5\nedge_index = erdos_renyi_graph(num_nodes, p)\n\n# Create random node and edge features\n```",

The awards are designed to spotlight innovative leaders across brands, retailers, agencies and solutions providers who are effectively leveraging or helping others leverage retail media for successful digital and omnichannel campaigns.\nIdeal candidates for the Retail Media Awards are professionals in retail media who meet criteria such as:\nAre trailblazers making impactful change in their company and in the industry;\nHave led successful campaigns and/or innovative new solutions in retail media;\nContribute significantly to the advancement and evolution of retail media as it relates to connected commerce across the path to purchase.\n\n[person]\nDescribe why this person is deserving of a retail media award and their contributions to the commerce marketing industry.\nMinimum 200 words\n\nThere is no denying the power of Skai\u2019s award-winning retail media technology solutions. But even the best technology being operated by the wrong people is worthless. So it\u2019s fortunate that when combined with the strategic influence, industry expertise and technological know-how of Kelly Fogt, you have a truly unbeatable combination!\n\nKelly is the Director of Commerce Expert Services at Skai, a team of expert practitioners that guide clients through the transition to Skai, acting as an extension of the client organization. As the account lead for one of our largest clients, Bayer, Kelly manages the relationship and serves as the liaison between Skai and the client. She works closely with multiple teams at Bayer to understand their programs, implement new solutions, and advocate within Skai to develop or customize features according to Bayer\u2019s needs. She understands her client\u2019s ecommerce and retail media needs first-hand, and uses her expertise to then influence Skai\u2019s product roadmap and the future of the product. Some of Skai\u2019s most revolutionary and influential solutions in the industry have been born from Kelly\u2019s trusted relationship with Bayer.\n\nFor example, Skai\u2019s support for Instacart display advertising, Instacart optimized bidding, and Profiteo integration have been directly influenced and resulted from meeting Bayer\u2019s needs, with more custom projects in the works. Bayer regularly has a heavy influence on what metrics we pull into the Skai platform and the custom solutions we develop. \n\nIn a world where siloed retail media and ecommerce are not enough, Kelly brings her previous experience in other channels to the table to develop and facilitate an omnichannel strategy for Bayer. With deep experience in paid search, Kelly has taken her learnings and best practices from this channel and applied them to retail media to increase Bayer\u2019s success. She is able to hyperfocus on audiences and what moves the needle, taking top performing keywords from search to Amazon campaigns and driving brand personalization by testing \u201cout of category targeting.\u201d Because she understands the search side so well, she can make informed recommendations for retail media that are unique, making her a true pioneer in omnichannel marketing.\nList any notable relevant achievements and recent successful campaigns or retail media solutions the nominated individual has led, created, or significantly contributed to.\n\nSince managing Skai\u2019s relationship with Bayer, Kelly has earned and increased the client\u2019s trust in Skai, as demonstrated by Bayer\u2019s length of relationship and increased budget. In 2021 Bayer signed on with Skai\u2019s Expert Services, a team of Skai experts that function as an extension of the client\u2019s retail media team. They are hands-on-keyboard and run the client\u2019s campaigns. While most Expert Services trial periods are a few months, Bayer is still with us today, having expanded its scope from two brands to 15. As Skai has continued to prove more value, Bayer has invested more budget into the Skai platform, with an increase of almost $1 million from 2022 to 2023. \n\nManaging retail media campaigns for 15 different brands with separate budgets, different audiences, varying goals, and countless retail media networks is no small feat. With a huge network of retailers, there is a lot of room for error. Under Kelly\u2019s leadership, it\u2019s been nothing but success.\n\nUpon working with the client, the first few months focused heavily on restructuring the Amazon Ads program and implementing both Amazon and Skai best practices. After that, the team was able to focus on strategy, including personalization within each of the 15 brands and custom creative, images, videos, tighter keyword strategy, and a negative keywords strategy. After earning their trust, Bayer was ready to test something they had never tried before: competitor ASIN targeting, something most brands do not do on Amazon. Now they are testing our new AI Dayparting tool, pulling every lever we can within Skai and even customizing the solutions to ensure success. \n\nAlready in early 2023, the results are proving much stronger than when Bayer was with one of our competitors. This is a huge testament to the amount of granularity the team went into for programs to drive strategy across the board.\n\nBeyond managing so many brands on Amazon, what makes Bayer a unique client is its desire to move toward an omnichannel approach, but a siloed business structure and different teams for each channel. To combat this siloed approach, Kelly runs weekly meetings with all teams to align on priorities, leads quarterly business reviews with Bayer, and meets with Skai\u2019s various teams including client success, product, and industry leads. She successfully manages relationships with many different stakeholders and meets and balances expectations for all. When needed, she even fills in, hands-on-keyboard to manage the client\u2019s campaigns.\n\nAs for what\u2019s next, Bayer is ready to replicate this U.S.-based strategy to its Canadian program, this region with 27+ brands, each with unique budgets and goals. \n\n[instructions]\nGet professional help: Microsoft recommends getting professional help with writing award submissions.

Add a function to your React component that parses the Additional Notes text and extracts the Acceptance Criteria in Gherkin format. You can use a regular expression to match the text following the \"Acceptance Criteria\" subheading and extract the lines of text that start with \"Given,\" \"When,\" or \"Then.\"\n2. Create state variables for each of the Acceptance Criteria data fields in your React component. You can initialize these state variables to an empty string.\n3.

Render the Acceptance Criteria data fields in your component, using the state variables as the values for each field.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to implementing this in your React/Ruby on Rails web application:\n\n1. In your React component, add a function that parses the Additional Notes text and extracts the Acceptance Criteria in Gherkin format.

      "response": "To create 5 independent Spring Java microservices with CRUD operations, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the entities: Decide on the entities for each microservice and their relationships. Make sure that you have a clear understanding of the one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between them.\n2. Create the microservices: Create the microservices using Spring Boot, Spring Data, and Spring MVC. Use the Spring Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project for each microservice.\n3. Implement CRUD operations: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each microservice using Spring Data JPA. This involves creating repositories, entities, and controllers for each microservice.\n4. Define APIs: Define APIs for each microservice using Spring MVC. This involves creating REST endpoints for each CRUD operation.\n5. Test the microservices: Test each microservice individually and ensure that they are functioning as expected.\n6. Integrate the microservices: Once the microservices are tested and working individually, integrate them using REST APIs. This involves calling the APIs of one microservice from another.\n7. Implement data persistence: Implement data persistence between the microservices. This can be done using either a shared database or by using message queues.\n8. Deploy the microservices: Deploy the microservices to your chosen environment.\n9. Monitor and maintain the microservices: Monitor and maintain the microservices to ensure that they are running smoothly.\n\nRemember to keep the microservices independent and loosely coupled so that changes to one microservice do not affect the others.",

      "response": "The biggest failing of international criminal justice is perhaps the limited scope of its jurisdiction and the difficulty in enforcing its decisions. International criminal justice systems, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), have jurisdiction only over crimes committed within their specific legal frameworks, and therefore cannot address all crimes committed across the world. Moreover, the effectiveness of international criminal justice is often hindered by lack of cooperation from states, including non-cooperation in arrest and extradition of accused individuals, or non-compliance with orders for the execution of sentences.\n\nAnother challenge facing international criminal justice is the uneven distribution of resources, which often results in a lack of resources for investigation, prosecution, and defense. This can lead to uneven application of justice, with some defendants receiving inadequate representation, and some victims failing to receive redress for the harm they have suffered.\n\nFinally, international criminal justice can be politically charged, with states and international actors seeking to use it to further their own interests. This can lead to selective enforcement of justice, in which some individuals are targeted for prosecution while others are shielded from accountability.",

      "response": "Certainly! Here's a technical overview of a referral system similar to Dropbox's, but instead of free space, users will earn \"credits\" for every three friends they recommend.\n\n1. Database schema:\nTo implement this referral system, you'll need a database schema to store user information and their referral relationships. The schema should include the following tables:\n* Users: This table will store basic user information like user\\_id, email, username, and total\\_credits.\n* Referrals: This table will store referral relationships, including referrer\\_id (the user who sent the referral), referee\\_id (the invited user), and referral\\_status (whether the referral is pending, accepted, or rejected).\n1. Unique referral links:\nTo track referrals, generate unique referral links for each user. When a new user signs up using a referral link, associate their account with the referrer's user\\_id. This can be achieved by appending a referral code (such as a unique hash) to the signup URL, which can be mapped back to the referrer's user\\_id.\n2. Referral tracking and credit calculation:\nTrack the number of successful referrals for each user. When a new user signs up using a referral link, update the Referrals table with the new relationship and set the referral\\_status to 'pending'. Once the new user completes the necessary steps to qualify as a successful referral (e.g., email verification, account activation), update the referral\\_status to 'accepted'.\n\nPeriodically (or using a trigger), calculate the number of successful referrals for each user. For every three successful referrals, award the referrer with additional credits. Update the Users table to reflect the new credit balance.\n\n1. API endpoints:\nDevelop the following API endpoints to support the referral system:\n* GET /referral-link: Generate and return a unique referral link for the logged-in user.\n* POST /signup: Create a new user account and process the referral, if any. This should include validating the referral code, associating the new user with the referrer, and updating the Referrals table.\n* GET /referral-status: Retrieve the referral status and credit balance for the logged-in user.\n1. Frontend integration:\nIntegrate the referral system into your application's frontend by adding the following components:\n* Referral link sharing: Allow users to share their unique referral link via email, social media, or other messaging platforms.\n* Referral status dashboard: Display the user's referral status, including the number of successful referrals and their credit balance.\n* In-app notifications: Notify users when they've earned additional credits from successful referrals.\n1. Analytics and monitoring:\nMonitor the performance of the referral system, tracking metrics such as the number of successful referrals, credits awarded, and the conversion rate of referred users. Use this data to optimize the referral process and identify potential issues.\n\nIn summary, the proposed referral system will involve creating a database schema to store user and referral information, generating unique referral links, tracking referrals and awarding credits, and integrating these features into your application's frontend.",

The goal is to develop a system that can optimize traffic signal control in real-time, taking into account factors such as traffic flow, pedestrian volume, and environmental conditions.\n\nDeep reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal behavior by trial and error. In the context of traffic signal control, reinforcement learning can be used to optimize signal timing and phasing in response to changing traffic conditions.\n\nData science techniques, such as data mining and predictive modeling, can be used to analyze data on traffic flow and other relevant factors, in order to identify patterns and predict future traffic conditions. This information can then be fed into the reinforcement learning algorithm to improve its performance and accuracy.\n\nBy combining deep reinforcement learning and data science techniques, it is possible to develop a system that can adapt to changing traffic conditions in real-time, optimizing traffic signal control to minimize congestion, reduce travel time, and improve safety on the road. This has the potential to revolutionize the way we manage traffic in cities, reducing congestion and improving the overall efficiency of transportation systems.",

The lower and upper limits are 0 and 5%\nrespectively. Crystale also receives royalties whenever a digital asset is sold on the secondary\nmarket(s).\nImmutable X takes 2% fee on all primary sales.

If a player doesn\u2019t have the asset to complete a\nspecific challenge, they have the option to rent the one that is required. Crystale receives rental\nfees of 3% for the days the asset is effectively rented out. Additionally, Crystale will also\nimplement the Battle Pass system.

Eko will be entering via servicing packages and supplying riders with programs and better rates. We are aiming for a more long term partnership and their team is aligned with the same goal.\n\nOn our last meeting with their riders' engagement & partnership team we've also introduced FBX entity and the possibility of having FBX having an affiliate program for the riders to seamlessly sign up for panda through our app with a referral incentive to us. The idea is pre-mature but doable in approval pov. We can also think about how to offer new and re-loans to their rider (can be walker, e-bike or motorbike) community via upgrades, trade-ins, new purchases.\n\nIn the shorter execution, I pitched that on their upcoming event this 30th Jan they can consider sponsoring their riders who have fulfilled certain trips upon onboarding and paying (partial) of their monthly installment on their behalf. Giving us a list of details that we minimally need to map to our customers and with a 5-7 days processing time. So onboard the riders on Eko end and partner with FBX for riders' incentive.\n\nWe're in the discussion phase and will iron out the details before finalizing.

      "response": "To add a field in your `Workflow` model to indicate the order of forms in the workflow, you can use a `Map` where the key is the order number and the value is the `Form` object. You can define the map as follows:\n```less\n@ElementCollection\n@MapKeyColumn(name = \"form_order\")\n@Column(name = \"form_id\")\n@CollectionTable(name = \"workflow_form_order\", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = \"workflow_id\"))\n@OrderBy(\"form_order ASC\")\nprivate Map<Integer, Long> formOrder;\n```\nIn this code, `formOrder` is the map that maps order numbers to form IDs. The `@ElementCollection` annotation indicates that this field is not an entity, but a collection of basic types. `@MapKeyColumn` specifies the name of the column for the order number, and `@Column` specifies the name of the column for the form ID. `@CollectionTable` specifies the name of the table for the collection, and `@JoinColumn` specifies the name of the column that references the `Workflow` table. Finally, `@OrderBy` specifies the order in which the entries in the map should be sorted.\n\nTo remove the form ID from the map when the associated form is deleted, you can add a `@PreRemove` method to your `Form` entity that removes the form ID from all workflows that contain it:\n```scss\n@PreRemove\npublic void removeFormFromWorkflows() {\n    for (Workflow workflow : authorizedWorkflows) {\n        workflow.getFormOrder().values().removeIf(formId -> formId.equals(id));\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method loops through all workflows that contain the form and removes the form ID from their `formOrder` maps. Note that you will need to add a `List<Workflow>` field to your `Form` entity to store the workflows that contain the form:\n```kotlin\n@ManyToMany(mappedBy = \"authorizedForms\")\nprivate List<Workflow> authorizedWorkflows;\n```\nMake sure to also update the `authorizedForms` field in your `Account` entity to maintain the bidirectional relationship between `Form` and `Workflow` entities.",

This may not be frequent enough for your use case. You can try reducing the polling interval to 100ms or even less. However, keep in mind that this will increase the load on your node.\n2. Use a different provider: If you are using Chainstack as your provider, you may want to try using a different provider like Infura or Alchemy. Sometimes, issues like this can be caused by the provider itself.\n3. Restart your node: It's possible that your node is experiencing some issues and needs to be restarted. Try restarting your node and see if that resolves the issue.\n4. Check your gas limit: If you are running out of gas during event polling, your node may stop listening for events. Check your gas limit and increase it if necessary.\n5. Check for errors: Check your logs for any errors that may be causing the issue. You may need to update your code to handle these errors.\n6. Use a different library: If none of the above solutions work, you may want to try using a different library for interacting with smart contracts. There are many libraries available, such as ethers.js and web3.py, which you can use to interact with smart contracts.",

      "response": "This error message indicates that Webpack, the module bundler used by Cypress, is not configured to handle the file type of your Cucumber feature files.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to configure Webpack to use a loader that can process the feature files. One popular loader for this is the `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor` package.\n\nHere are the steps you can take to fix the error:\n\n1. Install the `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor` package as a dev dependency:\n```css\nnpm install --save-dev cypress-cucumber-preprocessor\n```\n2. Create a new file named `cypress/plugins/index.js` if it doesn't exist, and add the following code to register the `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor`:\n```javascript\nconst cucumber = require('cypress-cucumber-preprocessor').default\n\nmodule.exports = (on, config) => {\n  on('file:preprocessor', cucumber())\n}\n```\n3. Create a new file named `cypress.json` if it doesn't exist, and add the following configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"testFiles\": \"**/*.feature\"\n}\n```\nThis tells Cypress to look for `.feature` files in your project's directory when running tests.\n4. Add the following line to your `cypress/support/index.js` file:\n```python\nimport './commands'\n```\nThis imports the custom commands that come with the `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor` package.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running your tests again. This should configure Webpack to handle the feature files and allow your tests to run successfully.",

      "response": "Vue.js is a JavaScript framework for building web applications. It was designed to be easy to use and to make it simple to get started building web applications. Vue.js uses a template-based syntax that allows you to declaratively render dynamic data to the DOM. It also provides a reactive component model, which means that when data changes, the view updates automatically. This makes it easier to build complex, data-driven user interfaces. Vue.js is often used in single-page applications (SPAs), but it can also be used to build traditional server-rendered applications. Do you have any specific questions about Vue.js?",

Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard's podcast and reporting on the dark underbelly of the internet.\nSee More \u2192\nThe RESTRICT Act, a proposed piece of legislation which provides one way the government might ban TikTok, contains \u201cinsanely broad\u201d language and could lead to other apps or communications services with connections to foreign countries being banned in the U.S., multiple digital rights experts told Motherboard.\n\nThe bill could have implications not just for social networks, but potentially security tools such as virtual private networks (VPNs) that consumers use to encrypt and route their traffic, one said. Although the intention of the bill is to target apps or services that pose a threat to national security, these critics worry it may have much wider implications for the First Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe RESTRICT Act is a concerning distraction with insanely broad language that raises serious human and civil rights concerns,\" Willmary Escoto, U.S. policy analyst for digital rights organization Access Now told Motherboard in an emailed statement.\n\nDo you know anything else about the RESTRICT Act? We'd love to hear from you.

The pair introduced the bill earlier this month, which is deliberately not limited to just TikTok.\n\nUnder the RESTRICT Act, the Department of Commerce would identify information and communications technology products that a foreign adversary has any interest in, or poses an unacceptable risk to national security, the announcement reads. The bill only applies to technology linked to a \u201cforeign adversary.\u201d Those countries include China (as well as Hong Kong); Cuba; Iran; North Korea; Russia, and Venezuela.\n\nThe bill\u2019s language includes vague terms such as \u201cdesktop applications,\u201d \u201cmobile applications,\u201d \u201cgaming applications,\u201d \u201cpayment applications,\u201d and \u201cweb-based applications.\u201d It also targets applicable software that has more than 1 million users in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe RESTRICT Act could lead to apps and other ICT services with connections to certain foreign countries being banned in the United States. Any bill that would allow the US government to ban an online service that facilitates Americans' speech raises serious First Amendment concerns,\u201d Caitlin Vogus, deputy director of the Center for Democracy & Technology\u2019s Free Expression Project, told Motherboard in an emailed statement. \u201cIn addition, while bills like the RESTRICT Act may be motivated by legitimate privacy concerns, banning ICT services with connections to foreign countries would not necessarily help protect Americans' privacy. Those countries may still obtain data through other means, like by purchasing it from private data brokers.\u201d\n\nEscoto from Access Now added, \u201cAs written, the broad language in the RESTRICT Act could criminalize the use of a VPN, significantly impacting access to security tools and other applications that vulnerable people rely on for privacy and security.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany individuals and organizations, including journalists, activists, and human rights defenders, use VPNs to protect their online activity from surveillance and censorship. The RESTRICT Act would expose these groups to monitoring and repression, which could have a chilling effect on free speech and expression,\u201d Escoto wrote.\n\n(Many VPN companies engage in misleading marketing practices which exaggerate their importance and alleged security benefits. Used correctly, and with a provider that does not introduce its own issues such as logging users\u2019 traffic, VPNs can be a useful tool for digital security).\n\nAdvertisement\nRachel Cohen, communications director for Senator Warner, responded by telling Motherboard in an email \u201cThis legislation is aimed squarely at companies like Kaspersky, Huawei and TikTok that create systemic risks to the United States\u2019 national security\u2014not at individual users.\u201d She added \u201cThe threshold for criminal penalty in this bill is incredibly high\u2014too high to ever be concerned with the actions of someone an individual user of TikTok or a VPN.\u201d\n\nWith the bill\u2019s introduction, Warner and Thune instead pointed to other foreign-linked companies that may pose their own security and privacy issues.\n\n\u201cBefore TikTok, however, it was Huawei and ZTE, which threatened our nation\u2019s telecommunications networks. And before that, it was Russia\u2019s Kaspersky Lab, which threatened the security of government and corporate devices,\u201d Warner said in a statement at the time. \u201cWe need a comprehensive, risk-based approach that proactively tackles sources of potentially dangerous technology before they gain a foothold in America, so we aren\u2019t playing Whac-A-Mole and scrambling to catch up once they\u2019re already ubiquitous.\u201d\n\nSens. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Susan Collins (R-ME), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), and Mitt Romney (R-UT) are co-sponsors of the proposed legislation\n\nBoth Vogus and Escoto pointed to another potential solution: the U.S. passing a more fundamental privacy law.\n\n\u201cIf Congress is serious about addressing risks to Americans\u2019 privacy, it could accomplish far more by focusing its efforts on passing comprehensive privacy legislation like the American Data Privacy and Protection Act,\u201d Vogus said.\n\nUpdate: This piece has been updated to include comment from Senator Warner\u2019s office.\n\nSubscribe to our cybersecurity podcast, CYBER.

      "response": "The Motherboard article discusses the RESTRICT Act and how it is being criticized for containing \"insanely broad\" language. The article suggests that the bill's language is vague and could lead to the ban of other apps or communications services that have connections to foreign countries, including VPNs. While the intention of the bill is to target apps or services that pose a threat to national security, critics worry that it may have much wider implications for the First Amendment. Caitlin Vogus, deputy director of the Center for Democracy & Technology's Free Expression Project, argues that the RESTRICT Act could lead to the ban of ICT services with connections to foreign countries and expose groups to monitoring and repression, which could have a chilling effect on free speech and expression. Willmary Escoto, U.S. policy analyst for digital rights organization Access Now, argues that the broad language in the RESTRICT Act could criminalize the use of VPNs, significantly impacting access to security tools and other applications that vulnerable people rely on for privacy and security. Rachel Cohen, communications director for Senator Warner, responds by arguing that the legislation is aimed at companies that create systemic risks to the United States' national security, not individual users.",

      "prompt": "What about Python?",
      "response": "Sure, here are a few \"Wat\" style examples for Python, highlighting some quirks and unexpected behaviors:\n\n1. List multiplication\n```python\na = [0] * 3\nprint(a)  # Output: [0, 0, 0]\n```\nWat? In Python, when multiplying a list by an integer, it repeats the list contents that many times, creating a new list.\n\n1. Tuple with a single item\n```python\na = (1)\nprint(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n```\nWat? In Python, to create a single-item tuple, you need to include a trailing comma. Without the comma, the parentheses are considered as grouping, not creating a tuple.\n\n1. Dynamic typing\n```python\na = \"3\"\nb = 5\nprint(a * b)  # Output: 33333\n```\nWat? In Python, when you multiply a string by an integer, it repeats the string that many times.\n\n1. Chaining comparison operators\n```python\na = 5\nprint(0 < a < 10)  # Output: True\n```\nWat? Python allows you to chain comparison operators, resulting in a more readable way to write compound comparisons.\n\n1. Dictionary key collisions\n```python\nd = {True: 'yes', 1: 'no', 1.0: 'maybe'}\nprint(d)  # Output: {True: 'maybe'}\n```\nWat? In Python, dictionary keys must be unique, and since `True`, `1`, and `1.0` are equal, they are treated as the same key. The last assigned value wins, so the value associated with the key `True` is `'maybe'`.\n\nThese examples showcase some quirks and unexpected behaviors you might encounter while working with Python. Understanding these nuances can help you avoid confusion and potential bugs in your code.",
